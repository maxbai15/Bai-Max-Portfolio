Choosing depends on what tasks you plan to do most often. - This challenge gives you a variety of different componenets ranging from high end to low end for every component. This means you have to choose wisely when choosing which parts you want to have high end components vs low end components.</p>"},{"location":"classes/ap-networking/202509component-cards/#4-testing-evaluation","title":"4. Testing &amp; Evaluation","text":"<p>Hardware: - Test: Type a sentence and save file - Sequence: Had to think through the hardware component used for typing a sentence and saving them. Thought about it starting at the power all the way to the I/O Devices - Image: Hardware Flow Chart - Bugs: When sharing different people's boards with the entire class, everyone discovered different parts where they could have improved.

Cooling was selected to prevent overheating during extended gaming sessions. Also I chose the top end GPU over the CPU since GPU's are usually more important for smoother gaming experiences.</p>"},{"location":"classes/ap-networking/202509component-cards/#5-reflection-analysis","title":"5. Reflection &amp; Analysis","text":"<p>I learned how hardware and software work together to perform computing tasks. The CPU acts as the brain, RAM temporarily stores data, and the GPU accelerates display and computation. Software layers allow applications to communicate with hardware through drivers and the OS. The Build-A-PC challenge helped me learn to make trade-offs to optimize for gaming, balancing cost, and performance. These lessons mirror real-world computing and network system design. By learning the basic components, we can understand how pcs function and work. If there every was a problem or a component needed to be upgraded, we could determine which one. Some next steps could include exploring cloud storage and exploring how the cli works.</p>"}]}
