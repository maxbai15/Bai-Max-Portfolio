### Common LAN Threats

In a switched LAN environment, a standard endpoint device like an unmanaged workstation is arguably the easiest target for an attacker to compromise. These devices often have less  security configurations than critical network infrastructure like firewalls or core switches. This contrasts with infrastructure devices which are generally better hardened and less exposed to direct threats.
A device being “inside” the network is generally far more dangerous for the entire organization than one outside. Internal positioning bypasses initial perimeter defenses like firewalls and intrusion prevention systems, granting an attacker direct access to internal resources, sensitive data, and the ability to move  across the network to compromise further systems. Outside devices must contend with multiple layers of security designed to detect and block unauthorized access attempts.
By default, a typical device inside a switched LAN has limited visibility into other devices' traffic. A switch learns which devices are on which ports and only forwards traffic intended for a specific destination to that port. However, an attacker can learn a great deal about the network's structure, the IP addresses and MAC addresses of other devices, open ports, and potentially intercept traffic if they use specific techniques like Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) spoofing or port mirroring.
