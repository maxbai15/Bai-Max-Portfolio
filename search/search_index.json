Project Overview Problem Statement: Learn to navigate and manage a Linux system through the command line, practicing foundational Ubuntu commands while applying them in structured challenges. Objectives: - Navigate file systems with commands like pwd , cd , and ls . - Manage files and directories using mkdir , touch , cp , rm . - Apply advanced commands for hidden files, editing, and system checks. - Complete Map the Maze I & II activities and the House activity to demonstrate mastery. Success Criteria: - Correct use of CLI commands to solve navigation and file management tasks. - Completion of activities with correct sequences. - Evidence of working tests (screenshots, logs, or tables). 2. Design & Planning \u2013 Map the Maze I, Ubuntu Tutorial, and Troubleshooting Networks The design and planning stage focused on building a foundation for understanding the file tree system, working in the Ubuntu command line, and learning the necessary skills to navigate through the command line. Starting with Map the Maze I , it introduced me first to the different terminology for understanding file paths and how they work, such as what a parent directory is vs a root directory. After that, Map the Maze I taught me about many basic commands like pwd (to check my current directory), cd (to move into another directory), and ls (to see the contents of a folder). This helped me understand that the CLI requires precision: a mistyped command or wrong directory name will not work. At the same time, I followed the Ubuntu tutorial , which gave me a broader context for why these commands matter. It covered file creation ( mkdir , touch ) and file editing ( nano ). This tutorial complemented Map the Maze I by showing real-world uses of the same basic skills I was practicing. Together, Map the Maze I and the tutorial gave me the tools I needed for the next phases of the project. They also served as my \u201cplan,\u201d since I now had a clear set of commands I could apply to more complex tasks. Additionally, we began learning about troubleshooting networks, learning about the methods to and different termonlogy. Below is the four steps to check connection: 1. Check whether your device is connected. 2. Verify if it has an IP address. 3. Test whether it can reach the internet at all. 4. Confirm if it can look up website names. File Tree System Terminology Term Definition / Example Root Directory (/ or C:) Very top of the file system tree. On Mac/Linux, it\u2019s represented as a single slash / . On Windows, it usually starts with a drive letter, such as C:\\ . All folders and files branch downward from this starting point, like branches from the trunk of a tree. Example: On Windows, C:\\Users\\John\\Documents\\essay.docx begins at C:\\ (the root). On Mac, /Users/John/Documents/essay.docx begins at / (the root). Folder (Directory) A folder, also called a directory, is a container used to organize files and other folders. Helps organize related files. Example: A folder named Documents might contain files like essay.docx and budget.xlsx and a subfolder named School . File A file is a single digital object that holds data, such as text, images, video, or code. Example: notes.txt is a text file, photo.jpg is an image file. Path A path is the \u201caddress\u201d of a file or folder, showing its location inside the file system. Path written as a sequence of folder names separated by slashes ( / ) on Mac/Linux or backslashes ( \\ ) on Windows. Example: Mac/Linux: /Users/John/Documents/essay.docx ; Windows: C:\\Users\\John\\Documents\\essay.docx . Absolute Path Absolute path gives the complete address of a file, starting at the root directory. Example: Mac/Linux: /Users/John/Documents/essay.docx ; Windows: C:\\Users\\John\\Documents\\essay.docx . Relative Path A relative path shows the location of a file or folder starting from your current working directory (where you are right now). Example: If your current folder is /Users/John , the relative path to essay.docx in Documents is Documents/essay.docx . CLI Commands Command Purpose Example pwd Show current directory /home/student ls List files and folders ls -a cd Change directory cd Documents mkdir Create directory mkdir Maze touch Create file touch clue.txt nano Edit a file nano clue.txt Example Text Version of My File System Tree I Drew: Troubleshooting Network Terms Term Definition Wi-Fi / Ethernet Signal carrier - ways your computer connects to the internet IP address Internet Protocol - Identifiable address given to a device Default gateway (router) Device to connect local network to the internet DNS (Domain Name System) Like the internet\u2019s \u201cphonebook\u201d translating user-friendly domain names (like google.com) into IP addresses Ping Method used to test connectivity between two devices (Ex. ping -c 4 8.8.8.8 ) NAT / Shared networking (UTM) Network function to pool all devices on a private network into one public IP Address before sending to external networks Bridged networking (UTM) VM acts like a completely separate computer To test our knowledge of the terms and connection testing steps, we completed a slideshow with different problems and steps to check connection in the wrong order. Our goal was to put the different steps in the right order. Below is photos showing the before and after for each scenario: Scenario 1(before vs after): Scenario 2(before vs after):: Scenario 3(before vs after): 3. Technical Development \u2013 Map the Maze II and Troubleshooting Network Activity In the technical development stage , I worked through Map the Maze II , which expanded on the basics from Maze I. This activity required me not just to move around directories, but also to create, edit, copy, and discover hidden files. For example, I used touch to create files, nano to edit their contents, and cp to duplicate them. One of the biggest lessons was using ls -a to reveal hidden files, which showed me that sometimes information is present but not visible without the right command. This activity also gave me practice in versioning: each step built on the last. At first, I simply navigated and confirmed my location. Then I began creating and editing files. Finally, I put it all together by managing multiple files and finding/creating my own hidden clues. Some Commands Used and Why Task Command(s) Used Notes Navigate directories cd , pwd Used constantly to stay oriented Create folder mkdir MazeGame Built a workspace Create file touch clue1.txt Added clue file Edit file nano clue1.txt Inserted instructions Mount PC sudo mount -t davfs http://127.0.0.1:9843/ ~/hostshare/ Allow sharing file from Mac to virtual Machine Show hidden files ls -a Discovered hidden files in Maze Game Editing clue1 and reading what was inside: Sharing Clue1 onto hostshare so both mac and ubuntu can access: By the end of Map the Maze II, I could confidently use multiple commands together to solve more complex tasks. Troubleshooting Network Issues In addition to Map the Maze II, I also completed the Troubleshooting Network Issues assignment, which focused on diagnosing and fixing internet connectivity problems in both Mac and Ubuntu environments. This assignment tied directly into the four key troubleshooting steps we learned earlier: Check whether the device is connected. Verify if it has an IP address. Test whether it can reach the internet at all. Confirm if it can look up website names (DNS). Key Tasks and Results Task Command(s) Used Findings Check IP on Mac ifconfig Found private IP: 10.12.17.223 (valid 10.x.x.x range) Disconnect/reconnect Wi-Fi ifconfig Observed IP disappearing/reappearing when Wi-Fi toggled Ping Google (8.8.8.8) ping -c 4 8.8.8.8 Success, avg 7.237 ms Ping Cloudflare (1.1.1.1) ping -c 4 1.1.1.1 Success, avg 8.717 ms (slower than Google) Find default gateway route -n get default (Mac) / ip route (Ubuntu) Mac: 10.32.0.1 , Ubuntu: 192.168.62.1 Ping router ping -c 4 <gateway> Very fast response (0.963 ms), faster than public servers Test DNS ping -c 4 google.com Successful \u2013 showed DNS was resolving correctly Check IP on Ubuntu (Shared) ip addr IP: 192.168.64.2/24 (hidden behind Mac) Check IP on Ubuntu (Bridged) ip addr IP: 10.32.1.33/23 (acts like its own device) IP address info on Ubuntu shared mode: - Red is adapter name - Blue is the IP address - Green is MAC address 4. Testing & Evaluation \u2013 House Activity The testing and evaluation stage was the House Activity , which acted as the ultimate test of whether I could apply all the commands I had learned. Instead of being a linear maze, the House required me to move through rooms, inspect items, and complete tasks. This activity was a file system directory simulated as a house that I was required to navigate through. This tested not only my command knowledge but also my ability to adapt and think logically to navigate throught the different directories and find out information and even remove/edit information. For example, starting in the \u201challway\u201d, you would have to use pwd to confirm your location, then use cd to enter specific rooms like the Kitchen and ls to check what was inside. Some rooms required cleaning up files and even discovering trash(hidden files in the garage directory), so you had to be sharp and disocver hiddden files and delete with rm. Also, some tasks required creating notes using nano and leaving messages for the owner. Some Commands Used and Why Step Action Command(s) Evaluation Locate self Check starting directory pwd Correct path displayed Move to room Enter Kitchen cd Kitchen Successful navigation to different areas of the house Inspect room List files ls Saw visible items like food (files) Clean up Delete file rm trash.txt Removed unnecessary files like garbage Create note Add message nano note.txt Left messages for the house owner Reveal hidden Show hidden items ls -a Found secret files (hidden garbage in the garage) Navigating through the kitchen directory, taking out fruit and getting rid of rotten fruit: Navigating through the garage directory, finding hidden trash and removing it: Bugs & Fixes: - Initially forgot to use ls -a and missed hidden files; fixed after retracing steps. - Used wrong capitalization ( cd kitchen instead of cd Kitchen ); corrected to work. This activity served as the final test combining skills from the Ubuntu tutorial and both Map the Maze parts. 5. Reflection Completing the CLI assignments gave me a deeper understanding of how to navigate the command line and file tree system. Through Map the Maze I & II and the House Activity, I learned that precision and attention to detail are critical: even small mistakes, like a wrong directory name or missed hidden file, can prevent progress. I also recognized the importance of planning and iteration. By breaking each activity into smaller steps, testing commands, and observing their effects, I troubleshoot and find hidden files or find the files I needed to change. The project reinforced the value of combining foundational skills with real-world application, such as mounting shared directories or managing multiple files simultaneously. Finally, this project helped to improve my problem-solving skills and adaptability. Navigating the simulated house and discovering hidden files required logical thinking and making sure the right files were removed/editied and hidden files were found. Along with that, I am beginning to develop skills to troubleshoot networks by searching connectivity to the wifi, ip addresses over the network, and confirming through Domain Same Server(DNS). Overall, I now feel more competent in using the Linux command line and troubleshooting through networks, and I understand how these skills will support future technical challenges.","title":"Command Line Interface"},{"location":"classes/ap-networking/202509CLI/#command-line-interface-cli","text":"","title":"Command Line Interface (CLI)"},{"location":"classes/ap-networking/202509CLI/#1-project-overview","text":"Problem Statement: Learn to navigate and manage a Linux system through the command line, practicing foundational Ubuntu commands while applying them in structured challenges.

Reflection"},{"location":"classes/ap-networking/202509SecurityControls/","text":"Determining Security Controls for Devices 1. Project Overview Problem Statement: Learn how devices connect to the internet, diagnose network issues using the 4-step troubleshooting flow, and apply/discover cybersecurity strategies and systems. Objectives: - Use Mac and Ubuntu CLI tools ( ifconfig , ip addr , ping , netstat , ufw ) to test connectivity - Apply the 4-step troubleshooting flow - Identify and evaluate open network ports/services on a VM - Enable firewall rules (UFW) and explore encryption basics Success Criteria: - Correctly perform network checks on Mac and Ubuntu VMs - Identify security risks (extra ports, unencrypted disks) - Enable and test a firewall/encryptions in Ubuntu 2. Design & Planning - Troubleshooting Flow & Vocabulary Troubleshooting Flow: Learned to always start at the endpoint device and test systematically: Check connection (Wi-Fi/Ethernet, VM mode). Verify IP address. Test reachability with ping. Confirm DNS lookups. Networking Vocabulary Wi-Fi/Ethernet: ways devices connect to the internet IP address: unique identifier for a device on the network Default gateway: router connecting local network to the internet DNS: translates names (google.com) to IP addresses Ping: tests connectivity between devices NAT (shared): VM hides behind host device Bridged networking: VM acts like its own device Cybersecurity Fundamentals \u2013 CIA Triad Confidentiality: keeping information secret from unauthorized users (e.g., encryption). Integrity: ensuring data remains accurate, uncorrupted, and trustworthy. Availability: making sure information and systems are accessible when needed. Common Device Vulnerabilities Outdated operating systems - missing security updates. Unencrypted data - easier for attackers to read if stolen. Weak passwords - can be cracked - use strong/random generation. Open ports - entry points like \u201cdoors/windows\" - necessary for services but must be managed. Examples: 80 (HTTP \u2013 old websites) 443 (HTTPS \u2013 secure websites) 22 (SSH \u2013 remote login) 25 (SMTP \u2013 email transfer) 110 (POP3) 143 (IMAP) 3389 (RDP \u2013 remote desktop) 53 (DNS \u2013 domain lookups) Unpatched software - vulnerabilities fixed by updates/patches (Windows \u201cPatch Tuesday,\u201d browser updates, mobile app patches). Tree Diagram of Termonology: 3. Technical Development \u2013 Network Testing and Cybersecurity Labs In the technical development stage , moved from theory into practical work by testing networks on both Mac and Ubuntu and applying cybersecurity measures. On Mac, began with ifconfig to identify my IP address. The result showed a valid private address ( 10.x.x.x ), confirming that my device was connected to the school\u2019s network. When toggling WIFI on and off, the IP disappeared and then reappeared. Next, tested connectivity by pinging public servers. Using ping -c 4 8.8.8.8 (google DNS) gave a fast average response time of about 7 ms. Pinging Cloudflare ( 1.1.1.1 ) worked as well, but slightly slower at 8 ms. To compare, pinged the school\u2019s default gateway ( 10.32.0.1 ) and found it responded even faster (0.9 ms) since it was local. Finally, I confirmed DNS resolution with ping google.com , proving that my device could translate names to IP addresses. On Ubuntu, I used ip addr to check IP addresses in both shared (NAT) and bridged modes. Shared gave me a 192.168.x.x address, meaning the VM was hidden behind my Mac, while bridged gave me a 10.x.x.x address, showing the VM could act like its own device. This side-by-side testing taught me the trade-offs between convenience (shared mode) and realism (bridged mode). I also began applying cybersecurity practices by checking for open ports with netstat -tuln . Ports like 22 (SSH) and 53 (DNS) were expected, but I also saw port 631 for printing, which wasn\u2019t needed. To improve security, I enabled Ubuntu\u2019s firewall using sudo ufw enable and blocked Telnet on port 23 with sudo ufw deny 23/tcp . Key Tasks and Results Task Command(s) Used Findings Check IP on Mac ifconfig Found private IP: 10.12.17.223 (valid 10.x.x.x range) Disconnect/reconnect Wi-Fi ifconfig Observed IP disappearing/reappearing when Wi-Fi toggled Ping Google (8.8.8.8) ping -c 4 8.8.8.8 Success, avg 7.237 ms Ping Cloudflare (1.1.1.1) ping -c 4 1.1.1.1 Success, avg 8.717 ms (slower than Google) Find default gateway route -n get default (mac) / ip route (ubuntu) Mac: 10.32.0.1 , Ubuntu: 192.168.62.1 Ping router ping -c 4 <gateway> Very fast response (0.963 ms), faster than public servers Test DNS ping -c 4 google.com Successful \u2013 showed DNS was resolving correctly Check IP on Ubuntu (shared) ip addr IP: 192.168.64.2/24 (hidden behind Mac) Check IP on Ubuntu (bridged) ip addr IP: 10.32.1.33/23 (acts like its own device) Scan open ports netstat -tuln Found SSH, DNS, and unnecessary ports Enable firewall sudo ufw enable Activated UFW protection Block insecure service sudo ufw deny 23/tcp Closed Telnet port IP address info on Ubuntu shared mode: - Red is adapter name - Blue is the IP address - Green is MAC address Finding the ports: Enable Firewall: Closed TCP Port: 4. Testing & Evaluation \u2013 Outdated Software The testing & evaluation phase taught us about outdated software and potential risks. In the VM, we would use different commands to install certain softwares and test to see what verion they were. After finding out the version, the goal was to compare the version on the VM to the most updated version. In my case, most of the VM softwares was not up to date. We also had to determine the risks for the software not being up to date. Software Command Used VM Version Why It Matters (Risk) OpenSSL openssl version Outdated Encrypts data on websites could be leaked Firefox firefox --version Outdated Supports open web and user privacy, web services not up to date LibreOffice libreoffice --version Outdated Alternative to commercial office suits Python python3 --version Outdated Coding languages lots of libraries built off of Apache HTTP Server apache2 -v Up to Date Web infrastructure, sites could fail GIMP gimp --version Outdated Digital editing, limited user interface Java java -version Outdated Code might not run properly OpenSSH ssh -V Outdated Secure connections to remote servers Example Installing and Checking Version(Firefox): 5. Reflection Completing these networking and cybersecurity activities gave me a much deeper understanding of both troubleshooting and defending systems.

On Mac, began with ifconfig to identify my IP address. The result showed a valid private address ( 10.x.x.x ), confirming that my device was connected to the school\u2019s network. When toggling WIFI on and off, the IP disappeared and then reappeared. Next, tested connectivity by pinging public servers. Using ping -c 4 8.8.8.8 (google DNS) gave a fast average response time of about 7 ms. Pinging Cloudflare ( 1.1.1.1 ) worked as well, but slightly slower at 8 ms. To compare, pinged the school\u2019s default gateway ( 10.32.0.1 ) and found it responded even faster (0.9 ms) since it was local. Finally, I confirmed DNS resolution with ping google.com , proving that my device could translate names to IP addresses. On Ubuntu, I used ip addr to check IP addresses in both shared (NAT) and bridged modes. Shared gave me a 192.168.x.x address, meaning the VM was hidden behind my Mac, while bridged gave me a 10.x.x.x address, showing the VM could act like its own device. This side-by-side testing taught me the trade-offs between convenience (shared mode) and realism (bridged mode). I also began applying cybersecurity practices by checking for open ports with netstat -tuln .

Project Overview Problem Statement: Understand how to strengthen device authentication and system security by designing secure passwords, enabling multi-factor authentication (MFA), and maintaining system integrity through regular software patching and updates. Objectives: - Design a strong password algorithm that meets NIST and OWASP guidelines - Change the default Ubuntu password using an algorithm-generated strong password - Install and configure MFA (pam_google_authenticator) for secure SSH logins - Perform and verify system patching using Ubuntu\u2019s update and log tools Success Criteria: - Password algorithm demonstrates length, complexity, and unpredictability - MFA setup confirmed with working verification code and SSH login test - System logs show successful patching activity and current updates applied - Reflection connects password policies, MFA, and patching to better security 2. Design & Planning \u2013 Authentication Concepts & Password Algorithm Password Security Foundations Strong passwords rely on three core factors: length, complexity, and unpredictability. Longer passwords increase combinations an attacker must guess, complexity adds varied character types (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols), and unpredictability prevents attackers from using known patterns or personal information. Common threats include brute force, dictionary attacks, and credential stuffing, all of which can be mitigated by using random password generation and MFA. To strengthen authentication, industry standards such as NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) and OWASP (Open Worldwide Application Security Project) emphasize: - Favoring length over forced compelxity - Enabling multi-factor authentication - Blocking weak or reused passwords The below demonstrates how different authentication methods work together: Password Algorithm - ensures unpredictability MFA - adds verification beyond password Patching - protects system from known exploits Designed Password Algorithm The password generation method created for this unit used random selections of letters, numbers, and symbols to ensure unpredictability and security.

Technical Development \u2013 Implementing Authentication & Security This phase focused on applying and verifying authentication controls in Ubuntu, including password updates, MFA setup, and patching through CLI commands. Changing Default Password Using the Ubuntu terminal, the command passwd was executed to replace the default ubuntu password with a new one generated by the algorithm. Command used: passwd New password set: Used password alogrithm above to generate a complex password Verification: Successful authentication tested with sudo ls /root , confirming that the new password functioned with administrative privileges. Additional user management commands enhanced overall security: - sudo adduser <username> \u2013 Create a new personal account - sudo usermod -aG sudo <username> \u2013 Grant administrative permissions - sudo passwd -l ubuntu \u2013 Lock the default user account to prevent unauthorized access Changing Password: Successful Password Change: Enabling Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) MFA was implemented using Google Authenticator through the following process: Installation - sudo apt update - sudo apt install libpam-google-authenticator -y Setup - google-authenticator generated a QR code and secret key for time-based codes (TOTP) MFA QR Code: Configuration - SSH configuration edited to enable MFA in /etc/ssh/sshd_config - PAM stack modified by adding auth required pam_google_authenticator.so in /etc/pam.d/sshd Testing - MFA verified using simulated TOTP code from https://totp.danhersam.com - SSH login prompted for both password and 6-digit verification code MFA Success: System Patching and Updates Software patching was performed to fix vulnerabilities and ensure up-to-date security protection.

These unpatched systems could easily allow in data leaks and breaches through many different doors. Additionally, there may be zero-day vulnerabilities, security flaws that aren\u2019t recognized by the user, therefore no patches available. If hackers are able to find these zero-day vulnerabilities they could easily enter the system and the fix would take a while depending on if the user even found the leak. To ensure that patching happens, you could always try to use automatic updates so the computer always stays patched and up to date. 5. Reflection Through implementing layered security controls, this unit demonstrated the practical relationship between authentication, authorization, and system maintenance. Secure passwords protect confidentiality and MFA safeguards protect integrity by ensuring that access is verified. Additionally, consistent patching preserves availability by maintaining a functional and resilient system to both bugs and attacks. These activities reinforced the principle that cybersecurity requires defense in depth\u2014multiple layers working together rather than relying on a single control. The Ubuntu password algorithm exercise showed how unpredictability and length drastically reduce guessing risk. MFA through Google Authenticator demonstrated real-world two-factor authentication methods used by major organizations, adding an essential safeguard against stolen credentials and hackers. Patching the VM provided insight into how software vulnerabilities are discovered and fixed, highlighting the importance of staying updated against known and zero-day exploits. Regular updates also prevent attackers from using exploits in the wild that target unpatched systems. Patching helps to protect against \"open doors\" in systems for hackers to break there way into. Overall, this unit illustrated the importance of proactive protection to ensure cyber attacks don't happen and data isn't lost.","title":"Implementing Security for Devices"},{"location":"classes/ap-networking/202510ImplementSecurity/#implementing-security-for-devices","text":"","title":"Implementing Security for Devices"},{"location":"classes/ap-networking/202510ImplementSecurity/#1-project-overview","text":"Problem Statement: Understand how to strengthen device authentication and system security by designing secure passwords, enabling multi-factor authentication (MFA), and maintaining system integrity through regular software patching and updates.

The Ubuntu password algorithm exercise showed how unpredictability and length drastically reduce guessing risk. MFA through Google Authenticator demonstrated real-world two-factor authentication methods used by major organizations, adding an essential safeguard against stolen credentials and hackers. Patching the VM provided insight into how software vulnerabilities are discovered and fixed, highlighting the importance of staying updated against known and zero-day exploits. Regular updates also prevent attackers from using exploits in the wild that target unpatched systems. Patching helps to protect against \"open doors\" in systems for hackers to break there way into.

Technical Development \u2013 Ubuntu Networking Activities This phase focused on applying and verifying networking concepts in Ubuntu through command line tools. Installing Network Tools and Viewing IP Configuration Installation Commands: sudo apt update sudo apt install net-tools -y Viewing Network Configuration: ifconfig Understanding the Output: Term Meaning Purpose Example inet The IPv4 address assigned to the computer It identifies the computer on the network 192.168.64.6 \u2014 computer's unique address within your local network netmask Defines which portion of the IP address identifies the network and which part identifies the device Helps devices know who is on the same network and who is outside it 255.255.255.0 - the first three sets of numbers (192.168.64) identify the network, the last number (.6) identifies the specific device broadcast The broadcast address is used to send messages to all devices on the same local network used by computers to find each other 192.168.64.255 sends data to all devices in the 192.168.64 network Network Configuration Screenshot: Testing Connectivity with Ping Installation: sudo apt install iputils-ping -y Testing Commands: ping google.com ping 8.8.8.8 -c 3 Quick Explanation: Command Purpose Example Output ifconfig Shows your computer's network address 192.168.64.6 ping Tests if another computer or website is reachable 64 bytes from google.com traceroute Shows the route data takes to reach a destination 192.168.64.1 --> 10.0.0.1 Ping Test Results: Tracing Network Routes with Traceroute Installation: sudo apt install traceroute -y Testing: traceroute google.com My Results: How many hops: 23 How long did it take: 3 seconds Understanding traceroute Results: When you type traceroute google.com , the computer sends test packets of data toward Google's servers and keeps track of every \"hop\" that those packets pass through. Each hop is like a checkpoint between your computer and the destination. The data might travel through many routers, like the school network and city network, before it finally reaches Google. Traceroute Results: Binary, Decimal, and Hexadecimal Conversions Why Binary: All digital data is stored + transmitted with binary (base 2) Computers have signals -> \"1 is on\" or \"0 is off\" Use on/off to store: IP addresses MAC addresses (unique identifier for hardware) Packets Number Systems: Decimal or \"denary\" - humans 10 digits -> 0 to 9 Ones (10^0), tens (10^1), hundred (10^2),... 345 = 3(10^2) + 4(10^1) + 5(10^0) Binary - base 2 Each binary digit is a bit 8 bits = 1 byte 4 bits = nibble Example: 192.168.1.1 = 11000000.10101000.00000001.00000001 Hexadecimal - base 16 Example: 11000000101010000000000100000001 in hex is C0A80101 Each hex digit = 4 bits Binary to Hex to Denary Practice: IP Address Analysis with ipcalc Checking My IP Address: ip a My IP Address: 192.168.64.2/24 The IP address you see is shown in decimal form so humans can read it easily. However, your computer stores and processes it in binary, like this: 192.168.64.6 -> 11000000.10101000.01000000.00000110. Every device on the network communicates using these 1s and 0s, not the decimal numbers you see on the screen. Additionally, the /24 is called the subnet mask and it tells you how many of the 32 bits in the IP address belong to the network portion. Hexadecimal is also often used because it allows for the compression of binary numbers. Ipcalc: sudo apt install ipcalc -y ipcalc 192.168.64.6/24 Ipcalc Output Screenshot: Viewing IP in Hexadecimal Converting to Hex: printf '%02X%02X%02X%02X\\n' 192 168 64 6 Output: C0A84006 Each pair of hex digits represents one section (octet) of the IP address: A8 = 168 40 = 64 06 = 6 Hexadecimal IP Screenshot: VM to VM Network Communication Understand how data travels between two computers on the same LAN using real network tools. Identify Your IP Address Same commands as above, but both VM's need to find networking information. Commands used: ifconfig or ip a The IP addresses are how devices identify each other on a local network. Each VM will have a different IP address and devices need both to communicate. Test Connectivity with Ping Ping the partner VM IP address to test if connection between both VM's is stable. Command: ping <VM2_IP> Example: ping 192.168.64.7 Ping uses the ICMP protocol at the Network Layer to check if another device is reachable.

Reflection Through these networking labs, I gained a practical understanding of how data moves across networks and how the OSI and TCP/IP models apply in the transmission of data across devices and networks. The LAN city analogy helped make complex ideas more. Additionally, the binary, decimal, and hexadecimal conversion exercises showed why computers use binary and how hexadecimal provides a human readable shortcut for long binary values.

The VM to VM activity tied everything together as it ensured I knew how to make sure two different devices where connect and could transport data between each other. Understanding both OSI and TCP/IP clarified how each layer depends on the one below and serves the one above, an essential principle to teh success of the OSI layer and the transportation of data.

Project Overview Problem Statement: Understand how networks physically connect and communicate by exploring OSI Layers 1-3, building Ethernet cables, comparing network modes, designing topologies, and simulating a SOHO network. Objectives: Explore OSI Layer 1 and Layer 2 using Ubuntu commands Build and test Ethernet cables Compare shared and bridged network modes and their IP addressing Design and label common network topologies (star, bus, ring, mesh, hybrid) Create and simulate a SOHO network with proper IP addressing and firewall configuration Success Criteria: Complete documentation of OSI Layers 1 & 2 exploration with labeled screenshots Successfully constructed and tested Ethernet cables with video demonstrations Clear comparison table showing Shared vs. Bridged mode IP addressing Toplogy diagrams with color-coded connections Functional SOHO network simulation with connectivity tests 2. Design & Planning \u2013 OSI Layers and Network Design Understanding OSI Layers 1 and 2 The OSI Model organizes networking into seven layers, from physical hardware at the bottom to applications at the top. The first two layers form the foundation of all network communication. Layer 1: The Physical Layer The Physical Layer is the bottom layer of the OSI model and deals with hardware - the actual equipment that sends and receives electrical or optical signals. This layer is like the road system for data and includes: Cables (Ethernet, fiber optics, coaxial) Connectors and ports Wireless signals (Wi-Fi, Bluetooth) Network Interface Cards (NICs) or virtual interfaces When a computer sends data, it turns it into bits (1s and 0s) and pushes them across these physical pathways. Layer 2: The Data Link Layer The Data Link Layer sits directly above the Physical Layer and is responsible for making sure that data travels safely and accurately between devices on the same local network. Here, data is packaged into units called frames. Each frame includes: The data being sent The source MAC address (the sender's unique hardware ID) The destination MAC address (the receiver's hardware ID) Error-checking information to detect damage during transmission How the Two Layers Work Together: Layer 1 provides the physical foundation, dealing with the actual hardware (cables, switches, NICs) and converting data into raw electrical, optical, or radio signals for transmission over the physical medium. It has no intelligence and simply moves the signal. Layer 2 operates on top of this functional Layer 1 connection, organizing the raw bits into frames and using MAC addresses for reliable, node-to-node data transfer on the local network segment. Thus, Layer 1 provides the path, while Layer 2 manages access to that path and ensures the data reaches the correct local destination intact, including error detection and control. Network Topologies A network topology is the way that computers, devices, and other pieces of technology are arranged and connected within a network. It's like a map or blueprint that shows how data travels from one device to another. The topology you choose affects how well a network performs in terms of speed, cost, reliability, and scalability. Common Network Topologies: Topology Type Description Common Use Star One central switch or hub in the middle with all computers connecting to that central point Office networks and home Wi-Fi routers Bus A single straight line (\"backbone cable\") with all computers branching off Early Ethernet networks Ring Devices form a circle with connections between neighbors, data travels one way (or both in dual-ring) Some legacy fiber networks and token ring systems Mesh Every device connects to multiple others, showing redundancy - if one path breaks, another can still carry data Data centers and IoT or wireless mesh networks Hybrid Combine two or more types (for example, multiple Star networks connected in a Bus layout) Large organizations with multiple departments or floors SOHO Network Design A SOHO (Small Office / Home Office) network is the kind of network setup most people use at home or in a small business. It connects multiple devices so they can share internet access, files, and other resources. Core SOHO Components: Device Function Modem Connects your network to your Internet Service Provider (ISP) Router Directs (routes) traffic between your local devices and the internet; assigns IP addresses Switch Expands the number of wired ports for computers and printers Access Point (AP) Provides Wi-Fi to laptops, tablets, and phones Devices Endpoints like computers, printers, and smart TVs that use the network SOHO Network Diagram: 3. Technical Development \u2013 Implementing Authentication & Security Connections that Share Data and Resources In this activity, sort different devices into four different network types: Personal Area Network(PAN), Local Area Network(LAN), Metropolitan Area Network(MAN), Wide Area Network(WAN). Typically, in daily life, all four different networks are used. For the PAN, it is whenever you are connecting or using different personal device, like an iPhone. For LAN's, it is often used in your workplaces or at school. MAN's are used to connect different network across city areas, like traffic signals. Finally, WAN's are used to connect the whole world together, like the internet. Each network scales up and connects with both larger and smaller ones.

The active interface (for example, enp0s1 or eth0) was identified along with: Interface name: enp0s1 MAC address: 1a:63:23:39:a4:2c Broadcast address: ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff The MAC address is a unique hardware identifier that identifies the computer on the local network, while the broadcast address sends messages to every device on the network. ip link show Screenshot: Step 2: Explore ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) Command: arp -n ARP connects IP addresses (Layer 3) to MAC addresses (Layer 2) so that the computer knows where to send data physically. The output shows IP addresses and MAC addresses of devices the VM has communicated with on the local network. arp -n Screenshot: Step 3: View Network Traffic Statistics Command: ip -s link This command shows RX packets (received), TX packets (transmitted), and any errors. The data shows how much information has been sent and received by the VM's network interface, indicating the level of activity on the network. ip -s link Screenshot: Step 4: Capture Live Network Traffic Command: sudo tcpdump -c 5 This command captures five live packets traveling through the VM's network interface. The output shows source and destination MAC addresses along with the protocols being used (like ARP, IP, or ICMP). This data is important for troubleshooting and network monitoring because it reveals exactly what type of traffic is moving through the network and where it's going. tcpdump Screenshot: OSI Layers 1 & 2 Reflection: During the network exploration, discovered that a device's network interface identifies itself on a local network using its unique Media Access Control address, a hardware identifier \"burned into\" the Network Interface Card by the manufacturer. A key distinction is that a MAC address is a physical address operating at the Data Link Layer and is only relevant within the local network segment, whereas an Internet Protocol address is a logical address operating at the Network Layer and is used for global identification and routing across different networks. The Address Resolution Protocol serves as the crucial link between these two layers: when a device needs to communicate with another device on the same local network and it only knows the destination's IP address, it sends a broadcast ARP request asking \"Who has this IP address?\" The device with the matching IP address then responds with its specific MAC address, which the original device caches for future direct communication. When viewing live packets in tcpdump, the ARP requests and replies were readily visible, showcasing this essential constant background activity of address resolution that facilitates data exchange. Ultimately, the Physical Layer provides the physical medium for data transmission, while Layer 2 organizes this raw data into frames and uses MAC addresses to ensure those frames reach the correct local device, demonstrating their combined effort to move data through the network efficiently. Cable Constructing and Testing This lab involved building and testing Ethernet cables using the T568B wiring standard at the Physical Layer (Layer 1) of the OSI Model. Professional technicians make their own cables to create precise lengths, verify quality, and save on cost. T568B Wire Order Standard: Pin Wire Color (T568B) Pair Function 1 White/Orange Transmit + 2 Orange Transmit - 3 White/Green Receive + 4 Blue Unused / Power 5 White/Blue Unused / Power 6 Green Receive - 7 White/Brown Unused 8 Brown Unused Stripping, Arranging, and Crimping Step 1: Prepare the Cable Using the Solsop Pass Through RJ45 Crimp Tool Kit,measured approximately 12 inches of Cat5e cable, made a clean cut, and used the stripper to remove about one inch of the outer plastic jacket to expose four twisted pairs (eight wires total). Stripped Cable Screenshot: Step 2: Untwist and Arrange the Wires Carefully untwisted the four pairs and arranged them in the T568B color order: White/Orange, Orange, White/Green, Blue, White/Blue, Green, White/Brown, Brown. The wires were straightened until flat and parallel, then trimmed evenly to about \u00bd inch in length. Wires Aligned Screenshot: Step 3: Insert Wires into RJ45 Connector The eight wires were carefully slid into the RJ45 connector while maintaining the correct color order. Each wire reached the front of the connector and was visible through the clear plastic, with the outer cable jacket extending slightly inside for strength. Wires in Connector Screenshot: Step 4: Crimp the Connector The RJ45 connector was inserted into the crimping slot of the Solsop tool and the handles were squeezed firmly until a click was heard. The crimp tool pressed the metal contacts into the wires and cut off the excess ends. Both ends of the cable were completed using this process. Crimped Cable: Stripping Demonstration Video: Watch Stripping Demonstration Video Testing the Cable Both ends of the cable were plugged into the cable tester (main unit and remote unit). The indicator lights labeled 1-8 blinked in order, confirming that all eight wires were properly connected and aligned. The cable passed the test successfully. Cable Testing Demonstration Video: Watch Stripping Demonstration Video Cable Construction Reflection: The most challenging step in creating the cable was maintaining the correct wire order while inserting them into the RJ45 connector because the wires were very thin and kept moving out of alignment. Maintaining the correct wire order is critical for network reliability because even one incorrect wire will prevent the cable from passing the test and result in failed data transmission since the transmit and receive pairs must match on both ends. Building and testing cables connects directly to the Physical Layer (Layer 1) of the OSI Model because this layer deals with the actual hardware and physical signals that carry data, and the cable is the physical medium that those electrical signals travel through. In a real network, if a cable is built incorrectly but not tested, it could cause intermittent connection failures, slow data transfer speeds, or complete network outages that would be difficult to troubleshoot since the problem is hidden inside the cable. Labeling the cable and using these professional tools mirrored real-world industry practices because network technicians must clearly identify and organize cables in large installations, and use standardized wiring schemes ensures compatibility across different manufacturers and systems. Lab 3: Exploring IP Addresses in Shared and Bridged Mode This lab explored how network configuration settings affect IP addressing and how virtual machines connect to the internet by comparing Shared (NAT) and Bridged network modes. Part 1: Shared (NAT) Mode Step 1: Confirm Shared Mode and Find Internal IP Command: ip a In Shared (NAT) mode, the VM uses a private IP address from a virtual subnet (for example, 192.168.64.x). The UTM software acts as a translator between the VM and the real internet. Internal IP Address: 192.168.64.2/24 Understanding the Output: Term Explanation inet This line shows the IPv4 address (192.168.64.6) 192.168.64.6 Internal (private) IP address assigned by the virtual network inside UTM (the NAT network) /24 Represents the subnet mask (255.255.255.0), meaning the first 24 bits identify the network brd 192.168.64.255 The broadcast address for this subnet scope global dynamic enp0s1 \"Global\" means this IP can reach outside the VM (through NAT), \"dynamic\" means it was assigned automatically (DHCP) Shared Mode ip a Screenshot: Step 2: Find External (Public) IP Address Using Firefox, navigated to https://whatismyipaddress.com and recorded the external IP address. External IP Address: 173.95.44.210 This external (public) IP address represents how the rest of the internet sees the connection, and it's different from the internal IP. Shared Mode External IP Screenshot: Part 2: Bridged Mode Step 1: Switch to Bridged Mode In UTM, the network mode was changed from Shared (NAT) to Bridged (Advanced), and the VM was restarted. Step 2: Verify Bridged Mode and Find Internal IP Command: ip a New Internal IP Address: 10.24.0.168 This new address comes directly from the local network's router. The VM is now a separate device on the same network as the Mac. Bridged Mode ip a Screenshot: Step 3: Find External IP in Bridged Mode Using Firefox again, navigated to https://whatismyipaddress.com. External IP in Bridged Mode: 173.95.44.210 (stayed the same) Bridged Mode External IP Screenshot: Shared and Bridged Mode Reflection: In Shared mode, the internal and external IP addresses are different. The internal IP address that starts with 192.168.64.2 belongs to the local network while the IP address starting with 173.95.44.210 belongs to the internet. The virtual machine uses NAT when connecting to the internet to conserve IP addresses as it allows multiple private IPs to connect to the same public internet IP. Being in shared mode makes it easier to connect multiple VMs on one computer because they will all share the same private IP that is connected to the internet. The internal IP address changed from 192.168.64.2 in Shared mode to 10.24.0.168 in Bridged mode because the VM was now getting its IP directly from the local network router instead of from UTM's virtual network. The external IP address remained the same at 173.95.44.210 because both modes ultimately connect to the internet through the same physical network connection. In Bridged mode, the virtual machine acts more like a separate computer on the network rather than a computer behind another device because it gets its own IP address directly from the router just like any other device. An organization might choose Bridged mode instead of Shared (NAT) mode when they need VMs to be directly accessible from other devices on the network or when they're running servers that need to be reached from outside. Security or management challenges that could come with using Bridged mode include the VM being more exposed to network attacks since it's directly on the network, and IT administrators need to manage more IP addresses and ensure each VM is properly configured with firewalls. Comparison Table: Mode Internal (Private) IP External (Public) IP Notes Shared (NAT) 192.168.64.2 173.95.44.210 VM hidden behind Mac's connection Bridged 10.24.0.168 173.95.44.210 VM appears as separate device Network Topologies This activity involved creating labeled drawings for five common network topologies, each showing how devices connect and communicate. Star Topology: One central switch or hub in the middle with all computers connecting to that central point. Commonly used in office networks and home Wi-Fi routers. Star Topology Diagram: Bus Topology: A single straight line (\"backbone cable\") with all computers branching off. This was common in early Ethernet networks but is now outdated. Bus Topology Diagram: Ring Topology: Devices form a circle with connections between neighbors, and data travels one way (or both in dual-ring). Used in some legacy fiber networks and token ring systems. Ring Topology Diagram: Mesh Topology: Every device connects to multiple others, showing redundancy. If one path breaks, another can still carry data. Commonly used in data centers and IoT or wireless mesh networks. Mesh Topology Diagram: Hybrid Topology: Combines two or more types. Used in large organizations with multiple departments or floors. Hybrid Topology Diagram: Topology Reflection: Star topology would be easiest to set up for a small business because it only requires one central switch and individual cables to each device, making installation and troubleshooting straightforward since each connection is independent. Mesh topology would be the most reliable if one connection fails because every device has multiple paths to reach other devices, so if one link goes down the data can automatically reroute through another path. Mesh topology would also be most expensive to implement because it requires the most cables and network interfaces since every device must connect to multiple other devices, dramatically increasing hardware costs. The school uses a hybrid topology, most likely combining star topologies on each floor (with switches connecting classroom computers) that are then connected together using a bus or ring backbone between floors, because this approach provides both the simplicity of star topology locally and the scalability needed for a large building. The physical layout of a topology affects speed and reliability because the number of hops data must make impacts latency , and the redundancy of connections determines fault tolerance , with more direct connections generally improving speed while more redundant paths improve reliability but increase complexity and cost. Building and Testing a SOHO Network This lab involved designing a realistic SOHO network and simulating it using Ubuntu virtual machines to test connectivity and understand how devices communicate. Step 1: SOHO Network Design The network was designed for a small office with eight devices including 2 Ubuntu computers, 1 printer, 1 smartphone, 1 router, 1 switch, 1 access point, and 1 NAS device. The diagram shows clear labels for each device, IP addresses, and color-coded lines for wired (solid) and wireless (dashed) connections. SOHO Network Diagram: Step 2: Simulate and Test in Ubuntu Set Up and Identify IP Addresses Both partner VMs were set to Bridged mode and IP addresses were identified using ip a . IP Addresses: Computer A: 10.12.26.47 Computer B: 10.12.26.129 IP -a Screenshot: Test Connectivity Between Computers Command: ping 10.12.26.129 Successful Ping Screenshot(mine and partners): Step 3: Network Diagnostic Commands ARP Table: arp -a Routing Table: netstat -r ARP -a and Neststat -r Screenshot: Traceroute: sudo traceroute 8.8.8.8 Displays every \"hop\" packets take to reach Google's DNS server, visualizing how data travels through routers across different networks. Traceroute Screenshot: These commands reveal how the SOHO network communicates by showing the MAC addresses of local devices (arp), the routing decisions being made (netstat -r), and the path data takes to reach external networks (traceroute). ARP relates to Layer 2 by mapping MAC addresses on the local network, while netstat and traceroute show Layer 3 activity with routing across multiple devices. Step 4: Firewall Configuration Command: sudo ufw status sudo ufw enable The firewall was enabled to act as a security gate for the network, blocking unwanted connections and allowing safe traffic. Firewalls operate mainly at OSI Layers 3 and 4, filtering packets based on rules. Enabling a firewall protects the system by only allowing trusted data to pass through, which prevents unauthorized access and potential security threats from reaching the computer. Active Firewall Screenshot: Step 5: Simple Web Server (Application Layer) Computer B (Server): python3 -m http.server 8080 Computer A (Client): Opened Firefox and navigated to http://10.12.26.129:8080 The browser displayed a list of files hosted by Computer A, demonstrating the Application Layer by showing how one device can serve files to another over HTTP, which is the same protocol that real websites use. Web Server Connection Screenshot: 4. Testing & Evaluation \u2013 Network Verification All networking concepts were tested and verified through practical lab activities. Concept Test Performed Verification Result OSI Layer 1 ethtool enp0s1 Confirmed physical connection speed, duplex mode, and link status OSI Layer 2 ip link show , arp -n Identified MAC address and ARP table showing local device mapping Network Traffic tcpdump -c 5 Captured live packets showing source/destination MAC addresses Cable Construction Cable tester with indicator lights All 8 wires passed test in correct order (T568B standard) Shared Mode IP ip a and whatismyipaddress.com Internal: 192.168.64.2, External: 173.95.44.210 Bridged Mode IP ip a and whatismyipaddress.com Internal: 10.24.0.168, External: 173.95.44.210 VM Connectivity ping between partner VMs Successful replies with <1ms latency, 0% packet loss Routing netstat -r , traceroute google.com Displayed routing table and multi-hop path to external servers Firewall sudo ufw status Confirmed firewall active and protecting system Application Layer Python http.server Successfully served files between VMs over HTTP 5. Reflection Through these networking labs, I gained comprehensive hands on experience with the foundational layers of network communication and how physical infrastructure connects to logical addressing and data flow. The OSI Layers 1 and 2 exploration taught me that networking starts with physical hardware and MAC addresses before any IP addressing comes into play. Building and testing Ethernet cables showed me why proper Physical Layer construction is critical because even one misplaced wire completely breaks connectivity. The Shared versus Bridged mode comparison clarified how network address translation works and why organizations use NAT to conserve IPv4 addresses while adding security through network isolation. Shared mode hides the VM behind the host computer's IP address, which is safer but less flexible, while Bridged mode makes the VM appear as its own device with direct network access, which is more exposed but enables server functionality. Additionally, creating topology diagrams for star, bus, ring, mesh, and hybrid networks illustrated that network design involves tradeoffs between cost, reliability, and scalability. For example, star topology is simple and cheap but has a single point of failure at the central switch, while mesh topology is extremely reliable with redundant paths but expensive due to all the extra cabling and ports required. The SOHO network simulation brought everything together by requiring me to design a complete network with proper IP addressing, then test it using actual Ubuntu commands. Pinging between partner VMs proved Layer 3 connectivity, examining ARP tables showed Layer 2 MAC address mapping, running traceroute demonstrated how data crosses multiple networks to reach the internet, and enabling the firewall added essential security filtering. The Python web server activity was particularly interesting because it showed me how Application Layer protocols like HTTP depend entirely on other layers and the result of connectivity.","title":"Types of Networks & Connections and Devices"},{"location":"classes/ap-networking/202511TypesNetwork/#types-of-networks-connections-and-devices","text":"","title":"Types of Networks &amp; Connections and Devices"},{"location":"classes/ap-networking/202511TypesNetwork/#1-project-overview","text":"Problem Statement: Understand how networks physically connect and communicate by exploring OSI Layers 1-3, building Ethernet cables, comparing network modes, designing topologies, and simulating a SOHO network.

The first two layers form the foundation of all network communication. Layer 1: The Physical Layer The Physical Layer is the bottom layer of the OSI model and deals with hardware - the actual equipment that sends and receives electrical or optical signals. This layer is like the road system for data and includes: Cables (Ethernet, fiber optics, coaxial) Connectors and ports Wireless signals (Wi-Fi, Bluetooth) Network Interface Cards (NICs) or virtual interfaces When a computer sends data, it turns it into bits (1s and 0s) and pushes them across these physical pathways. Layer 2: The Data Link Layer The Data Link Layer sits directly above the Physical Layer and is responsible for making sure that data travels safely and accurately between devices on the same local network. Here, data is packaged into units called frames. Each frame includes: The data being sent The source MAC address (the sender's unique hardware ID) The destination MAC address (the receiver's hardware ID) Error-checking information to detect damage during transmission How the Two Layers Work Together: Layer 1 provides the physical foundation, dealing with the actual hardware (cables, switches, NICs) and converting data into raw electrical, optical, or radio signals for transmission over the physical medium. It has no intelligence and simply moves the signal. Layer 2 operates on top of this functional Layer 1 connection, organizing the raw bits into frames and using MAC addresses for reliable, node-to-node data transfer on the local network segment. Thus, Layer 1 provides the path, while Layer 2 manages access to that path and ensures the data reaches the correct local destination intact, including error detection and control.","title":"Understanding OSI Layers 1 and 2"},{"location":"classes/ap-networking/202511TypesNetwork/#network-topologies","text":"A network topology is the way that computers, devices, and other pieces of technology are arranged and connected within a network.

If one path breaks, another can still carry data. Commonly used in data centers and IoT or wireless mesh networks. Mesh Topology Diagram: Hybrid Topology: Combines two or more types. Used in large organizations with multiple departments or floors. Hybrid Topology Diagram: Topology Reflection: Star topology would be easiest to set up for a small business because it only requires one central switch and individual cables to each device, making installation and troubleshooting straightforward since each connection is independent. Mesh topology would be the most reliable if one connection fails because every device has multiple paths to reach other devices, so if one link goes down the data can automatically reroute through another path. Mesh topology would also be most expensive to implement because it requires the most cables and network interfaces since every device must connect to multiple other devices, dramatically increasing hardware costs. The school uses a hybrid topology, most likely combining star topologies on each floor (with switches connecting classroom computers) that are then connected together using a bus or ring backbone between floors, because this approach provides both the simplicity of star topology locally and the scalability needed for a large building. The physical layout of a topology affects speed and reliability because the number of hops data must make impacts latency , and the redundancy of connections determines fault tolerance , with more direct connections generally improving speed while more redundant paths improve reliability but increase complexity and cost.","title":"Network Topologies"},{"location":"classes/ap-networking/202511TypesNetwork/#building-and-testing-a-soho-network","text":"This lab involved designing a realistic SOHO network and simulating it using Ubuntu virtual machines to test connectivity and understand how devices communicate.

ARP relates to Layer 2 by mapping MAC addresses on the local network, while netstat and traceroute show Layer 3 activity with routing across multiple devices. Step 4: Firewall Configuration Command: sudo ufw status sudo ufw enable The firewall was enabled to act as a security gate for the network, blocking unwanted connections and allowing safe traffic. Firewalls operate mainly at OSI Layers 3 and 4, filtering packets based on rules. Enabling a firewall protects the system by only allowing trusted data to pass through, which prevents unauthorized access and potential security threats from reaching the computer.

The OSI Layers 1 and 2 exploration taught me that networking starts with physical hardware and MAC addresses before any IP addressing comes into play. Building and testing Ethernet cables showed me why proper Physical Layer construction is critical because even one misplaced wire completely breaks connectivity. The Shared versus Bridged mode comparison clarified how network address translation works and why organizations use NAT to conserve IPv4 addresses while adding security through network isolation. Shared mode hides the VM behind the host computer's IP address, which is safer but less flexible, while Bridged mode makes the VM appear as its own device with direct network access, which is more exposed but enables server functionality. Additionally, creating topology diagrams for star, bus, ring, mesh, and hybrid networks illustrated that network design involves tradeoffs between cost, reliability, and scalability. For example, star topology is simple and cheap but has a single point of failure at the central switch, while mesh topology is extremely reliable with redundant paths but expensive due to all the extra cabling and ports required.

Design & Planning \u2013 Understanding Physical and Logical Addressing MAC Addresses A MAC address (Media Access Control address) is a permanent hardware identifier assigned to every Network Interface Card (NIC) when it is manufactured. This physical address operates at Layer 2 of the OSI Model and is used for local network communication within the same network segment. MAC addresses are considered physical addresses because they are tied directly to physical hardware. A MAC address permanently identifies a specific network interface card. The address is embedded into the hardware at the factory and does not change even if the device moves to a different network. MAC Address Structure: Component Description Example First 3 bytes (OUI) Organizationally Unique Identifier - identifies the manufacturer 78:4f:43 Last 3 bytes Device Identifier - unique to that specific NIC 91:2a:10 Full MAC Address Complete 48-bit hardware address 78:4f:43:91:2a:10 Why Logical Addressing Exists? While MAC addresses work perfectly for local communication, they cannot help devices reach destinations outside the local network. This is where logical addressing (IP addresses) becomes essential. Physical vs Logical Addressing Comparison Venn Diagram of Physical vs Logical Addressing: IPv4 vs IPv6 IPv4 (Internet Protocol version 4): IPv4 was the first widely deployed system for global addressing but is running out of available addresses. Key Characteristics: 32-bit address: approximately 4.3 billion possible addresses Dotted-decimal notation: 192.168.1.10 Problems: Not enough addresses for billions of modern devices IPv6 (Internet Protocol version 6): IPv6 was created to solve IPv4's limitations and support long-term Internet growth.

Technical Development \u2013 Implementing Authentication & Security Understanding Physical Addressing In this activity, learn what a MAC address is, how it is structured, and why every networked device depends on it. Look at the physical device where it is located, a NIC, and compare with the different parts of a MAC Address and what they mean. Step 1: Physical MAC Addressing Screenshot of NIC(Ethernet Port, Main Controller Chip, PCIe Connector): Screenshot of NIC(Ethernet Port, Main Controller Chip, PCIe Connector): On a local network, MAC addresses provide a unique physical address, allowing data packets be sent to the correct destination. A MAC address is considered a physical address because it is a unique identifier hardcoded into a device's NIC during manufacturing. Seeing a physical NIC shows you this address is tied directly to the hardware itself. Step 2: Interpreting MAC Address Screenshot MAC Address Mac Address: fe:9c:d4:b2:67:53 OUI: fe:9c:d4 Vendor/company information not found, this can happen with virtualization vendors. A physical NIC's MAC address comes from the manufacturer, while a virtual NIC's MAC is either generated by the hypervisor or is manually configured. Both use the same structure and are unique identifiers, but physical MACs are tied to hardware, while virtual MACs are software-based and don't need a physical vendor ID. A virtual NIC still needs a MAC address because it's essential for the device to communicate on a local network, where devices use MAC addresses to identify each other at the data link layer. MAC Address Table Lookup | Full MAC Address | OUI(first 3 pairs) | Vendor/Company Name | Type of Vendor | Notes | |--------------|--------------|---------------------|-------|----| | F0:18:98:AA:BB:CC | F0:18:98 | Apple, Inc. | MA-L (Mac Address Block Large) | n/a | | 3C:5A:B4:11:22:33 | 3C:5A:B4 | Google, Inc. | MA-L | n/a | | 60:45:BD:12:34:56 | 60:45:BD | Microsoft | MA-L | n/a | | A4:BA:DB:22:33:44 | A4:BA:DB | Dell Inc. | MA-L | n/a | | 04:1A:04:55:66:77 | 04:1A:04 | WaveIP | MA-L | n/a | | 00:50:56:AA:BB:CC | 00:50:56 | VMware, INC. | MA-L | n/a | | 52:54:00:12:34:56 | 52:54:00 | Not Found | LLA (Locally Administered Addresses) | n/a | A VM's MAC address typically reveals the manufacturer of the virtual network interface card (NIC), which corresponds to the hypervisor vendor (ex. VMware, Microsoft). It does not provide information about the specific underlying physical hardware model or its manufacturer, as the address is virtual and can often be manually changed or spoofed. Step 3: Connecting Physical and Digital Mac Address: fe:9c:d4:b2:67:53 OUI: fe:9c:d4 Device Identifier: b2:67:53 The Organizational Unique Identifier (OUI) is a 24-bit globally unique number that serves as the first half of a device's MAC address. It connects a Network Interface Card (NIC) to its manufacturer because the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) assigns specific OUIs to individual vendors. Manufacturers must use unique OUIs to ensure that every network-enabled device in the world has a universally unique MAC address, which is essential for network communication protocols (like Ethernet and Wi-Fi) to function correctly and avoid address conflicts. Every NIC needs its own unique second half (the device identifier) because, combined with the manufacturer's unique first half (OUI), it creates a globally unique identifier for that specific hardware device. This mechanism, controlled by the IEEE and manufacturers, prevents two devices on the same LAN from having the same MAC address. Uniqueness is important for frame delivery because network switches use MAC addresses to build forwarding tables and send data frames to the exact, intended recipient; duplicate addresses would cause confusion, leading to inconsistent communication. The Data Link Layer (Layer 2) of the OSI model uses MAC addresses to facilitate communication between devices within the same local network segment. MAC addresses never leave the local network because they are designed for local identification, not routing across the broader internet. When a frame needs to move to a different network, a router strips off the source and destination MAC addresses and replaces them with the MAC addresses relevant to the next hop on the journey to the destination. Understanding Logical Addressing use ip addr show to find IPv4 address and IPv6 link-local address in terminal. ip addr show screenshot: IPv6 Link-Local and the Future of IPv6: An IPv6 link-local address is an automatically configured address for communication within a local network segment and always starts with \"fe80::\". It allows devices to find each other without needing a DHCP server or external configuration because the address is self generated based on the fe80:: prefix. These addresses are crucial for essential network functions, such as router discovery and automatic configuration, and are not routed beyond the local link. IPv4 is no longer sufficient because its 32-bit address space provides a theoretical maximum of approximately 4.3 billion unique systems globally. IPv6 solves this address shortage with a massive 128-bit address space that yields a virtually limitless number of addresses, ensuring that every device can have its own public IP. This transition is not just about quantity since IPv6 introduces new capabilities like more efficient routing, built-in security features, and better support for mobility and Quality of Service. During this multi year transition period, modern networks must support both IPv4 and IPv6 concurrently through mechanisms like dual stack operation to ensure seamless communication between existing systems and the new IPv6 infrastructure. IPv4 vs IPv6 Comparison Table: Feature IPv4 IPv6 Address Length Shorter 32-bit identifier Longer 128-bit identifier Notation Uses four groups of Binary (0-255) separated by dots Uses 8 groups of Hexadecimal separated by colons Approximate Capacity around 4.3 billion Basically limitless (over 18 quintillion) Example 192.168.1.1 fe80::2ffa:dca3:a63d Where I see it used More common on older systems and networks Increasingly seen on new systems and networks along with transitioning from IPv4 Why Logical Addressing Exists? Logical addressing exists in addition to physical MAC addresses because they serve different functions in the communication hierarchy. MAC addresses operate at the data link layer and are used solely for local communication within a single network segment, like identifying devices connected to the same switch or Wi-Fi router. In contrast, IP addresses operate at the network layer and are essential for global communication across the entire internet. Routers are the key devices that use IP addresses to efficiently forward data packets by inspecting the destination IP address in a packet's header and using routing tables to determine the next optimal path toward the destination network, rather than knowing the specific physical address of every single device globally. An example from personal experience involves web browsing, requesting a webpage results in the computer using the website's IP address to send the request out to the internet, and intermediate routers use that IP address to guide the request packet to the correct server thousands of miles away. Without IP addresses, data could never leave the local network boundary. Understanding Physical Addressing Dynamic addressing uses protocols like DHCP to automatically assign IP addresses to devices as they join a network, which is efficient for managing many temporary connections such as mobile phones and laptops. In contrast, static addressing involves a network administrator manually configuring a fixed, permanent IP address for a specific device. Networks require both methods to operate effectively as dynamic addressing handles general client connectivity with minimal overhead, while static addressing ensures that critical resources, such as servers and network gateways, are always reachable at a predictable address. Dynamic addressing is ideal for typical end-user devices that frequently connect and disconnect, while static addressing should be reserved for equipment that must maintain a consistent, unchanging location on the network for other systems to reliably find them. Use ip addr show to find IPv4 address and IPv6 link-local address in terminal. ip addr show in VM #1 ip addr show in VM #2 Network Configuration Files: Use ls /etc/netplan to find which Netplan file is loaded. Find Netplan File Screenshot VM #1: Use cat /etc/netplan/*.yaml to find whether the file contains dhcp4 or dhcp6. Netplan File Screenshot VM #1: On VM #2 use sudo cat /etc/netplan/*.yaml to find network configuration. If that doesn't work, you can use nmcli device show to find if it uses Netplan or NetworkManager. Netplan File Screenshot VM#2: Two different Linux VMs might employ distinct networking configuration tools, such as netplan on Ubuntu or NetworkManager on Linux, leading to varying configurations. While both can utilize DHCP for IPv4 address assignment, DHCP can only use IPv6 on the linux version. The configuration syntaxes are a bit different since VM#1 uses netplan while VM#2 uses network manager. Netplan uses YAML files for declaring the configuration and NetworkManager relies on command-line tools interfaces. This divergence in configuration approaches stems from different distribution design choices and the specific needs of administrators or automated systems Scenario Analysis Table: | Device | Static or Dynamic? | Justification (2 sentences) | |---------|---------------|---------------------| | School Web Server | Static | The web server must maintain a consistent, unchanging IP address so that users can reliably access the website. If its IP address changed frequently, external users would not be able to locate the server on the network. | | Classroom Printer | Static | Printers in a networked environment are generally assigned a static IP address to ensure all users can consistently send print jobs to the correct device. | | Student Laptops | Dynamic | Laptops are mobile devices that connect to different networks (different classrooms, home, public Wi-Fi). Using dynamic addresses allows the device to automatically obtain a new IP configuration from each new network's DHCP server without manual intervention. | | Security Cameras | Static | Security cameras need to be consistently accessible and locatable on the network for monitoring and recording purposes. A static IP ensures that monitoring software and network administrators always know exactly where to find the camera's feed. | | Teacher Workstation | Dynamic | Similar to student laptops, teacher workstations may be moved between different classrooms or offices. Using dynamic addressing simplifies network management and connectivity, allowing the device to easily connect with any network segment with a DHCP server. | Configuring and Verifying IP Addresses on a Linux VM Physical addressing uses a unique, permanent MAC address for local network identification, while logical addressing uses a temporary or permanent IP address for global identification on a network. An IP address can be assigned dynamically, changing over time and managed by a DHCP server for simplicity and efficiency, or assigned statically, remaining fixed for a specific device and used for things like remote access or hosting servers. This activity tests switching from DHCP to static addressing. Use ip link show to find active network interfaces. ip link show screenshot: From the screenshot, enp0s1 is the active network. Next to convert DHCP to Static IP to use sudo nano /etc/netplan/<filename>.yaml to edit the DHCP status. To find the filename you can use ls /etc/netplan (e.x. 50-cloud-init.yaml). Once opening the .yaml file, edit dhcp4 to say no and add in you own static addressing. Yaml File before Editing: Yaml File after Editing: Finally after changing the .yaml file, use sudo netplan apply to change from DHCP to the static IP address personally assigned. sudo netplan apply screenshot: Verify Static IP Configuration To verify that the static IP configuration worked, use ip addr show to confirm the IP address is the static address. Also, use ip route show to see a default gateway like something typed in the .yaml file (ex. default via 192.168.1.1 dev enp0s1). Finally, use ping -c 4 8.8.8.8 to test connectivity. ip addr show screenshot: ip route show screenshot: ping -c 4 8.8.8.8 screenshot: From the testing the ip addr show confirms that the static IP address is the new one for enp0s1 while the ip route show confirms that the routing with the new static ip address is right. Additionall, the ping demonstrates that connections using the new static ip address work. The most challenging part of IP configuration was likely troubleshooting IP address conflicts caused by manual static assignments. Manually assigning static IP addresses without a centralized management tool or a clear plan makes it easy for two devices to end up with the same address, which disrupts network communication and causes connectivity failures. Additionally, YAML syntax and networking settings are very sensitive. A single, misplaced space or an incorrect value in a YAML configuration file can completely break a network service or prevent a device from connecting. For instance, an incorrect subnet mask, default gateway, or DNS server IP, even if the address format is valid, will cause routing errors and block internet access. 4.

Reflection Through these addressing labs, I gained comprehensive understanding of how devices identify themselves at both the physical hardware level and the logical network level, and why both types of addressing are essential for modern networking. The physical addressing activities taught me that MAC addresses are permanently embedded into NICs during manufacturing and serve as the fundamental identifier for Layer 2 communication within local networks. I got to understand the physical components of the NIC along with the different identifiers for the MAC address. Additionally, I learned how Logical addressing through IP addresses works alongside MAC Addresses to provide connection since IP addresses complete the transformation of information for global connection. I also developed a strong understanding of the difference between DHCP and static addressing, especially how DHCP provides convenience for devices that change networks, while static addressing is required for predictable and stable access to different networks and servers. Comparing VM #1 and VM #2 helped me see how different systems utilize different tools, Netplan and NetworkManager, for managing network configuration. One of the most important lessons I learned was how sensitive YAML files are; even minor mistakes in spacing or indentation can break the entire network configuration. Switching VM #2 from DHCP to a static IP and verifying connectivity made the concepts feel real and connected everything I learned to practical, real-world network administration. Overall, this project strengthened my understanding of how addressing works from the hardware level all the way up to routing across networks, and how essential careful configuration is in any professional networking environment.","title":"Physical Addressing and Logical Addressing"},{"location":"classes/ap-networking/addressing/#physical-addressing-and-logical-addressing","text":"","title":"Physical Addressing and Logical Addressing"},{"location":"classes/ap-networking/addressing/#1-project-overview","text":"Problem Statement: Understand how devices identify themselves on networks through physical (MAC) and logical (IP) addressing, and learn how to configure both dynamic and static IP addresses.

IPv4 vs IPv6 Comparison Table: Feature IPv4 IPv6 Address Length Shorter 32-bit identifier Longer 128-bit identifier Notation Uses four groups of Binary (0-255) separated by dots Uses 8 groups of Hexadecimal separated by colons Approximate Capacity around 4.3 billion Basically limitless (over 18 quintillion) Example 192.168.1.1 fe80::2ffa:dca3:a63d Where I see it used More common on older systems and networks Increasingly seen on new systems and networks along with transitioning from IPv4 Why Logical Addressing Exists? Logical addressing exists in addition to physical MAC addresses because they serve different functions in the communication hierarchy. MAC addresses operate at the data link layer and are used solely for local communication within a single network segment, like identifying devices connected to the same switch or Wi-Fi router. In contrast, IP addresses operate at the network layer and are essential for global communication across the entire internet. Routers are the key devices that use IP addresses to efficiently forward data packets by inspecting the destination IP address in a packet's header and using routing tables to determine the next optimal path toward the destination network, rather than knowing the specific physical address of every single device globally. An example from personal experience involves web browsing, requesting a webpage results in the computer using the website's IP address to send the request out to the internet, and intermediate routers use that IP address to guide the request packet to the correct server thousands of miles away. Without IP addresses, data could never leave the local network boundary.","title":"Understanding Logical Addressing"},{"location":"classes/ap-networking/addressing/#understanding-physical-addressing_1","text":"Dynamic addressing uses protocols like DHCP to automatically assign IP addresses to devices as they join a network, which is efficient for managing many temporary connections such as mobile phones and laptops. In contrast, static addressing involves a network administrator manually configuring a fixed, permanent IP address for a specific device. Networks require both methods to operate effectively as dynamic addressing handles general client connectivity with minimal overhead, while static addressing ensures that critical resources, such as servers and network gateways, are always reachable at a predictable address. Dynamic addressing is ideal for typical end-user devices that frequently connect and disconnect, while static addressing should be reserved for equipment that must maintain a consistent, unchanging location on the network for other systems to reliably find them. Use ip addr show to find IPv4 address and IPv6 link-local address in terminal. ip addr show in VM #1 ip addr show in VM #2 Network Configuration Files: Use ls /etc/netplan to find which Netplan file is loaded. Find Netplan File Screenshot VM #1: Use cat /etc/netplan/*.yaml to find whether the file contains dhcp4 or dhcp6. Netplan File Screenshot VM #1: On VM #2 use sudo cat /etc/netplan/*.yaml to find network configuration. If that doesn't work, you can use nmcli device show to find if it uses Netplan or NetworkManager. Netplan File Screenshot VM#2: Two different Linux VMs might employ distinct networking configuration tools, such as netplan on Ubuntu or NetworkManager on Linux, leading to varying configurations. While both can utilize DHCP for IPv4 address assignment, DHCP can only use IPv6 on the linux version. The configuration syntaxes are a bit different since VM#1 uses netplan while VM#2 uses network manager. Netplan uses YAML files for declaring the configuration and NetworkManager relies on command-line tools interfaces. This divergence in configuration approaches stems from different distribution design choices and the specific needs of administrators or automated systems Scenario Analysis Table: | Device | Static or Dynamic? | Justification (2 sentences) | |---------|---------------|---------------------| | School Web Server | Static | The web server must maintain a consistent, unchanging IP address so that users can reliably access the website. If its IP address changed frequently, external users would not be able to locate the server on the network. | | Classroom Printer | Static | Printers in a networked environment are generally assigned a static IP address to ensure all users can consistently send print jobs to the correct device. | | Student Laptops | Dynamic | Laptops are mobile devices that connect to different networks (different classrooms, home, public Wi-Fi). Using dynamic addresses allows the device to automatically obtain a new IP configuration from each new network's DHCP server without manual intervention. | | Security Cameras | Static | Security cameras need to be consistently accessible and locatable on the network for monitoring and recording purposes. A static IP ensures that monitoring software and network administrators always know exactly where to find the camera's feed. | | Teacher Workstation | Dynamic | Similar to student laptops, teacher workstations may be moved between different classrooms or offices. Using dynamic addressing simplifies network management and connectivity, allowing the device to easily connect with any network segment with a DHCP server. |","title":"Understanding Physical Addressing"},{"location":"classes/ap-networking/addressing/#configuring-and-verifying-ip-addresses-on-a-linux-vm","text":"Physical addressing uses a unique, permanent MAC address for local network identification, while logical addressing uses a temporary or permanent IP address for global identification on a network. An IP address can be assigned dynamically, changing over time and managed by a DHCP server for simplicity and efficiency, or assigned statically, remaining fixed for a specific device and used for things like remote access or hosting servers. This activity tests switching from DHCP to static addressing. Use ip link show to find active network interfaces. ip link show screenshot: From the screenshot, enp0s1 is the active network. Next to convert DHCP to Static IP to use sudo nano /etc/netplan/<filename>.yaml to edit the DHCP status. To find the filename you can use ls /etc/netplan (e.x. 50-cloud-init.yaml). Once opening the .yaml file, edit dhcp4 to say no and add in you own static addressing. Yaml File before Editing: Yaml File after Editing: Finally after changing the .yaml file, use sudo netplan apply to change from DHCP to the static IP address personally assigned. sudo netplan apply screenshot: Verify Static IP Configuration To verify that the static IP configuration worked, use ip addr show to confirm the IP address is the static address. Also, use ip route show to see a default gateway like something typed in the .yaml file (ex. default via 192.168.1.1 dev enp0s1). Finally, use ping -c 4 8.8.8.8 to test connectivity. ip addr show screenshot: ip route show screenshot: ping -c 4 8.8.8.8 screenshot: From the testing the ip addr show confirms that the static IP address is the new one for enp0s1 while the ip route show confirms that the routing with the new static ip address is right. Additionall, the ping demonstrates that connections using the new static ip address work. The most challenging part of IP configuration was likely troubleshooting IP address conflicts caused by manual static assignments. Manually assigning static IP addresses without a centralized management tool or a clear plan makes it easy for two devices to end up with the same address, which disrupts network communication and causes connectivity failures. Additionally, YAML syntax and networking settings are very sensitive. A single, misplaced space or an incorrect value in a YAML configuration file can completely break a network service or prevent a device from connecting. For instance, an incorrect subnet mask, default gateway, or DNS server IP, even if the address format is valid, will cause routing errors and block internet access.","title":"Configuring and Verifying IP Addresses on a Linux VM"},{"location":"classes/ap-networking/addressing/#4-testing-evaluation-network-verification","text":"All addressing concepts were tested and verified through hands on activities and cli commands.

The physical addressing activities taught me that MAC addresses are permanently embedded into NICs during manufacturing and serve as the fundamental identifier for Layer 2 communication within local networks. I got to understand the physical components of the NIC along with the different identifiers for the MAC address. Additionally, I learned how Logical addressing through IP addresses works alongside MAC Addresses to provide connection since IP addresses complete the transformation of information for global connection. I also developed a strong understanding of the difference between DHCP and static addressing, especially how DHCP provides convenience for devices that change networks, while static addressing is required for predictable and stable access to different networks and servers. Comparing VM #1 and VM #2 helped me see how different systems utilize different tools, Netplan and NetworkManager, for managing network configuration. One of the most important lessons I learned was how sensitive YAML files are; even minor mistakes in spacing or indentation can break the entire network configuration. Switching VM #2 from DHCP to a static IP and verifying connectivity made the concepts feel real and connected everything I learned to practical, real-world network administration. Overall, this project strengthened my understanding of how addressing works from the hardware level all the way up to routing across networks, and how essential careful configuration is in any professional networking environment.","title":"5.

Understanding different security controls, like VLAN segmentation Determining physical vulnerabilties and ways to counteract 2. Design & Planning Before applying security controls, it is necessary to understand why internal LAN attacks are possible in the first place. Many core networking protocols were designed around efficiency and trust rather than security. Once a device gains physical or logical access to a switched LAN it can often observe and influence network behavior unless defensive controls are in place. Key LAN Security Concepts & Vocabulary Internal LAN Threats: Attacks that originate from inside the local network after a device is connected, rather than from an external attacker on the internet. Broadcast Domain: A group of devices that receive the same broadcast traffic, such as ARP requests and DHCP discovery messages. Large broadcast domains increase exposure to internal attacks. East\u2013West Traffic: Network traffic that flows between devices inside the LAN. Rogue Device: An unauthorized device connected to the network that may intercept traffic and exploit the network. VLAN Segmentation Virtual Local Area Networks (VLANs) divide a physical switch into multiple logical networks, each with its own broadcast domain. This limits exposure to broadcast traffic and isolates sensitive systems. DHCP Snooping DHCP Snooping protects the network from rogue DHCP servers that attempt to assign malicious IP configurations. Allows trusted ports to send DHCP offers while unauthorized ones cannot. Keeps a MAC address table that becomes a basis for many different security mechanism 3. Technical Development Common Security Controls On a LAN, devices such as misconfigured printers of access points like routers or switches would be the easiest place for an attacker to compromise since those are usually where the security is the weakest since people have to commonly access those devices. Proximity doesn't equal safety since wireless connections are often more vunerable through open gates/doors through wi-f/network connections. In a LAN devices can often see traffic involving the device and also open doors/ports. Scenario Letter Symptoms Hypothesis Justification Scenario A A device recieves a default gateway that does not match the actual router DHCP Misconfiguration The deafult ip is conigured by DCHP, but it doesn't seem to be the right gateway so it was configured incorrectly Scenario B The switch CPU spkies many MAC addresses appear on one port Cyberattack Many MAC addresses flooding the server would disrupt the transportation of information to the right places, destroying the network Scenario C Clients receive IPs from an unexpected source. DHCP Spoofing Random unauthorized source assings IP address, meaning that it could potentially be a false DHCP offer Scenario D A new unknown device appears inside the broadcast domain Bad Port Security If ports don't have security control, any unknown device can easily enter the network and communicate through the broadcast domain Scenario E A host begins reaching other internal hosts it should never reach Flat Network Since any device can reach other ones, that means the network is flat with no VLAN segmentation. This means any device within the network can communicate with other ones on the same network Security Controls Common Vulnerabilities ip addr and ip route VM#2 arping from VM#1 tcpdump on VM#2 ARP reveals the Media Access Control (MAC) addresses associated with specific Internet Protocol (IP) addresses of devices on a local area network (LAN). It operates by broadcasting a request asking which device has a particular IP address and expects the corresponding device to respond with its unique hardware address. ARP assumes devices are trustworthy because the original design philosophy of early networks, for which ARP was created, often prioritized functionality and efficiency over robust security, operating in what were considered inherently trusted local environments. The protocol has no built-in mechanisms for verification or authentication of responses; it simply accepts the first valid reply it receives as legitimate and caches the information for future use. This lack of authentication makes ARP vulnerable to spoofing because a malicious actor can send a false ARP reply, claiming to have the MAC address for a different device's IP address. Legitimate devices on the network will update their ARP caches with this incorrect information, inadvertently sending traffic meant for the legitimate device to the attacker instead. Bridged mode was likely required for this lab to work because it places the virtual machine directly onto the physical host's network, giving it a unique IP address on the same LAN as other devices. This configuration allows the virtual machine to participate in the broadcast domain and exchange ARP traffic directly with other physical and virtual hosts, which is essential for observing or performing ARP-related activities like spoofing within a realistic LAN environment. MAC Flooding Attack Diagram Physical Security Controls Enterprise Physical Security Threat Analysis 1. Unauthorized access to labs This vulnerability occurs at laboratory entrances that are insufficiently controlled or monitored. If unauthorized individuals gain access to labs, they could steal research data or damage sensitive equipment. 2. No restricted zones This vulnerability exists where public spaces such as lobbies or office areas are not clearly separated from restricted research or data center areas. Without proper zoning, an individual could move easily move from a low-critical area to a extremely-critical area. 3. Insufficient physical protection of network closets This vulnerability exists in network closets or server rooms that are unlocked, or poorly secured. Physical access to switches, servers, or patch panels allows attackers to connect rogue devices or disrupt network availability. 4. Lack of environmental controls This vulnerability occurs when temperature and airflow systems are inadequate. Servers and network devices are highly sensitive to environmental conditions such as overheating which may halt research operations and violate regulatory requirements. 5. Limited surveillance This vulnerability exists when cameras and alarm systems are missing or insufficient in labs, data centers, or network rooms. Without surveillance, increases the risk of theft, sabotage, and delayed incident response. 6. Weak visitor and personnel procedures This vulnerability stems from inconsistent enforcement of visitor policies, resulting in rogue attackers gaining access to the site. Physical Security Plan 1. Environmental Controls Redundant cooling systems, humidity control, and air filtration systems to constantly monitor temperature and prevent overheating in data centers. 2. Access Control Access to the facility is divided into security zones: public, restricted, and highly restricted. Badge based authentication is required at every door with the critical sections being highly-restricted to only a few staff members necessary. 3. Surveillance and Detection Cameras are installed all around the facility, inside every room, and at every entrace. All surveillance feeds are monitored from a centralized security operations area, and access logs are retained for auditing and investigations. Alarms alert security staff to unauthorized access attempts. 4. Hardware Security All servers and network devices are housed in locked racks within secured rooms. Network closets remain locked, and physical access to switch ports and patch panels is restricted to only a few members. 5. Personnel and Procedures Strict procedures are gone through to ensure visitors access to the facility. Visitors must be escorted at all times inside the facility and movemnet logged. Physical Security Diagram: Risk Justification and Priority Controls The highest priority physical controls for this pharmaceutical research facility is access control. Preventing unauthorized physical access to laboratories, data centers, and network infrastructure it extremely important to reduce the changes of unauthorized personnal tampering or stealing data. Physical security directly supports network segmentation, access control lists, and monitoring systems. When devices are physically protected, technical controls cannot be easily bypassed or disabled. Together, these measures reduce attacks and violations to ensure the integrity and availability of critical research operations. 4.

In a real SOHO network, routers provide Layer 3 routing between different subnets and assign devices to the same network, while switches create a Layer 2 broadcast domain, ensuring that devices on the same subnet can discover each other's MAC addresses and communicate directly.","title":"Reflection Paragraph"},{"location":"classes/ap-networking/xxxxx/","text":"Determining Security Controls in a LAN 1. Project Overview 2. Design & Planning \u2013 Understanding Physical and Logical Addressing 3. Technical Development \u2013 Implementing Authentication & Security Common LAN Threats In a switched LAN environment, a standard endpoint device like an unmanaged workstation is arguably the easiest target for an attacker to compromise. These devices often have less security configurations than critical network infrastructure like firewalls or core switches. This contrasts with infrastructure devices which are generally better hardened and less exposed to direct threats. A device being \u201cinside\u201d the network is generally far more dangerous for the entire organization than one outside. Internal positioning bypasses initial perimeter defenses like firewalls and intrusion prevention systems, granting an attacker direct access to internal resources, sensitive data, and the ability to move across the network to compromise further systems. Outside devices must contend with multiple layers of security designed to detect and block unauthorized access attempts. By default, a typical device inside a switched LAN has limited visibility into other devices' traffic. A switch learns which devices are on which ports and only forwards traffic intended for a specific destination to that port. However, an attacker can learn a great deal about the network's structure, the IP addresses and MAC addresses of other devices, open ports, and potentially intercept traffic if they use specific techniques like Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) spoofing or port mirroring. Screenshot Showing Evidence of Neighbor Discovery: A attacker could directly utilize the infromation in the screenshot because it can see the default gateway and potentially use that to try and enter the network. Additionally, the arp command demonstrates how once inside the network, attackers would be able to see other devices within the network. Scenario Table: Scenario Symptoms Hypothesis Justification Scenario A Multiple device have valid IP addresses but not gateway addresses that match the router, so they can't connect to internet DHCP Conflict Some devices might be getting assinged IP addresses from another router, causing certain devices to have valid IP addresses but the wrong default Scenario B High CPU performance because hundreds of MAC addresses appear on a single switch suddenly MAC Address Flooding Many MAC addresses flooding the server suddenly instead of gradually hints at an attack. Also it results in the slowing dont of the network which is what an attacker may try to do. Scenario C A few devices have been assigned IP addresses in the wrong subnet. DHCP is up, but the normal network documentation is different. DHCP Spoofing First, they are assigned the wrong IP addresses which could happen because of DHCP Spoofing. Additionally, the normal documentation differs which hints at this being an attack because it isn't an official assignment Scenario D An unseen device sunddenly communicates with multiple hosts on a network. Appears to come from a physical jack Rogue Network Device The unseen device enters during normal hours and is not authorized to be in the network. Assumed to come from a wall jack, it can easily enter the network since the physical ports are loose. Scenario E A student workstation with no admin rights is communicationg with restricted areas of the network No VLAN Segmentation Since no firewalls are trigged when the student workstation communicates with admin and server devices, their must be no segmentation since the lower level devices are able to enter restricted data. Switch Security Controls VM Evidence Vulnerability Control Why Mitigates Risk The first screenshot shows a flat network without vlan segmentation. The network has a switch with two end devices connected to it. With the flat segmentation, any device on the network can see other devices VLAN Segmentation Creating different VLANs will help to ensure all devices on the network can't see each other, only being split into networks where certain devices can see certain devices , The flat network from above The screenshots demonstrate the commands for creating two different VLANs(10 - Students, 20 - Servers). The second screenshot demonstrates the successful VLAN creation with the end devices assigned to different VLANs This helps mitigate risk since only devices on the same VLAN can now reach each other, protecting more critical devices like the server from just normal devices at the student level , Unprotected port security is a vulnerability since any device connecting to a port on the network gains access to the network without any problem The fire screenshot demonstrates how to enable this using switchport commands while the second screenshot is evidence of port security being enabled on both end devices for ports fa0/1 and fa0/2 Port Security helps to mitigate risks because it protects from a rogue device joining the network by simply just plugging in a device to the port. Physical access is important here since an unprotected port is like an open gateway to the network. The show arp and dhcp doesn't work since no requests are being made and ip address isnt setup on devices. Screenshot shows the configuration of the different ports on the switch. From it, doesn't show any rogue network so far Can use this to find unknown devices and problems in configuration Can help to mitigate risks because a technician can see configuration of devices on the switch and potentially scout out different potential attackers or harms 4.
