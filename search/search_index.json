Project Overview Problem Statement: Learn to navigate and manage a Linux system through the command line, practicing foundational Ubuntu commands while applying them in structured challenges. Objectives: - Navigate file systems with commands like pwd , cd , and ls . - Manage files and directories using mkdir , touch , cp , rm . - Apply advanced commands for hidden files, editing, and system checks. - Complete Map the Maze I & II activities and the House activity to demonstrate mastery. Success Criteria: - Correct use of CLI commands to solve navigation and file management tasks. - Completion of activities with correct sequences. - Evidence of working tests (screenshots, logs, or tables). 2. Design & Planning \u2013 Map the Maze I, Ubuntu Tutorial, and Troubleshooting Networks The design and planning stage focused on building a foundation for understanding the file tree system, working in the Ubuntu command line, and learning the necessary skills to navigate through the command line. Starting with Map the Maze I , it introduced me first to the different terminology for understanding file paths and how they work, such as what a parent directory is vs a root directory. After that, Map the Maze I taught me about many basic commands like pwd (to check my current directory), cd (to move into another directory), and ls (to see the contents of a folder). This helped me understand that the CLI requires precision: a mistyped command or wrong directory name will not work. At the same time, I followed the Ubuntu tutorial , which gave me a broader context for why these commands matter. It covered file creation ( mkdir , touch ) and file editing ( nano ). This tutorial complemented Map the Maze I by showing real-world uses of the same basic skills I was practicing. Together, Map the Maze I and the tutorial gave me the tools I needed for the next phases of the project. They also served as my \u201cplan,\u201d since I now had a clear set of commands I could apply to more complex tasks. Additionally, we began learning about troubleshooting networks, learning about the methods to and different termonlogy. Below is the four steps to check connection: 1. Check whether your device is connected. 2. Verify if it has an IP address. 3. Test whether it can reach the internet at all. 4. Confirm if it can look up website names. File Tree System Terminology Term Definition / Example Root Directory (/ or C:) Very top of the file system tree. On Mac/Linux, it\u2019s represented as a single slash / . On Windows, it usually starts with a drive letter, such as C:\\ . All folders and files branch downward from this starting point, like branches from the trunk of a tree. Example: On Windows, C:\\Users\\John\\Documents\\essay.docx begins at C:\\ (the root). On Mac, /Users/John/Documents/essay.docx begins at / (the root). Folder (Directory) A folder, also called a directory, is a container used to organize files and other folders. Helps organize related files. Example: A folder named Documents might contain files like essay.docx and budget.xlsx and a subfolder named School . File A file is a single digital object that holds data, such as text, images, video, or code. Example: notes.txt is a text file, photo.jpg is an image file. Path A path is the \u201caddress\u201d of a file or folder, showing its location inside the file system. Path written as a sequence of folder names separated by slashes ( / ) on Mac/Linux or backslashes ( \\ ) on Windows. Example: Mac/Linux: /Users/John/Documents/essay.docx ; Windows: C:\\Users\\John\\Documents\\essay.docx . Absolute Path Absolute path gives the complete address of a file, starting at the root directory. Example: Mac/Linux: /Users/John/Documents/essay.docx ; Windows: C:\\Users\\John\\Documents\\essay.docx . Relative Path A relative path shows the location of a file or folder starting from your current working directory (where you are right now). Example: If your current folder is /Users/John , the relative path to essay.docx in Documents is Documents/essay.docx . CLI Commands Command Purpose Example pwd Show current directory /home/student ls List files and folders ls -a cd Change directory cd Documents mkdir Create directory mkdir Maze touch Create file touch clue.txt nano Edit a file nano clue.txt Example Text Version of My File System Tree I Drew: Troubleshooting Network Terms Term Definition Wi-Fi / Ethernet Signal carrier - ways your computer connects to the internet IP address Internet Protocol - Identifiable address given to a device Default gateway (router) Device to connect local network to the internet DNS (Domain Name System) Like the internet\u2019s \u201cphonebook\u201d translating user-friendly domain names (like google.com) into IP addresses Ping Method used to test connectivity between two devices (Ex. ping -c 4 8.8.8.8 ) NAT / Shared networking (UTM) Network function to pool all devices on a private network into one public IP Address before sending to external networks Bridged networking (UTM) VM acts like a completely separate computer To test our knowledge of the terms and connection testing steps, we completed a slideshow with different problems and steps to check connection in the wrong order. Our goal was to put the different steps in the right order. Below is photos showing the before and after for each scenario: Scenario 1(before vs after): Scenario 2(before vs after):: Scenario 3(before vs after): 3. Technical Development \u2013 Map the Maze II and Troubleshooting Network Activity In the technical development stage , I worked through Map the Maze II , which expanded on the basics from Maze I. This activity required me not just to move around directories, but also to create, edit, copy, and discover hidden files. For example, I used touch to create files, nano to edit their contents, and cp to duplicate them. One of the biggest lessons was using ls -a to reveal hidden files, which showed me that sometimes information is present but not visible without the right command. This activity also gave me practice in versioning: each step built on the last. At first, I simply navigated and confirmed my location. Then I began creating and editing files. Finally, I put it all together by managing multiple files and finding/creating my own hidden clues. Some Commands Used and Why Task Command(s) Used Notes Navigate directories cd , pwd Used constantly to stay oriented Create folder mkdir MazeGame Built a workspace Create file touch clue1.txt Added clue file Edit file nano clue1.txt Inserted instructions Mount PC sudo mount -t davfs http://127.0.0.1:9843/ ~/hostshare/ Allow sharing file from Mac to virtual Machine Show hidden files ls -a Discovered hidden files in Maze Game Editing clue1 and reading what was inside: Sharing Clue1 onto hostshare so both mac and ubuntu can access: By the end of Map the Maze II, I could confidently use multiple commands together to solve more complex tasks. Troubleshooting Network Issues In addition to Map the Maze II, I also completed the Troubleshooting Network Issues assignment, which focused on diagnosing and fixing internet connectivity problems in both Mac and Ubuntu environments. This assignment tied directly into the four key troubleshooting steps we learned earlier: Check whether the device is connected. Verify if it has an IP address. Test whether it can reach the internet at all. Confirm if it can look up website names (DNS). Key Tasks and Results Task Command(s) Used Findings Check IP on Mac ifconfig Found private IP: 10.12.17.223 (valid 10.x.x.x range) Disconnect/reconnect Wi-Fi ifconfig Observed IP disappearing/reappearing when Wi-Fi toggled Ping Google (8.8.8.8) ping -c 4 8.8.8.8 Success, avg 7.237 ms Ping Cloudflare (1.1.1.1) ping -c 4 1.1.1.1 Success, avg 8.717 ms (slower than Google) Find default gateway route -n get default (Mac) / ip route (Ubuntu) Mac: 10.32.0.1 , Ubuntu: 192.168.62.1 Ping router ping -c 4 <gateway> Very fast response (0.963 ms), faster than public servers Test DNS ping -c 4 google.com Successful \u2013 showed DNS was resolving correctly Check IP on Ubuntu (Shared) ip addr IP: 192.168.64.2/24 (hidden behind Mac) Check IP on Ubuntu (Bridged) ip addr IP: 10.32.1.33/23 (acts like its own device) IP address info on Ubuntu shared mode: - Red is adapter name - Blue is the IP address - Green is MAC address 4. Testing & Evaluation \u2013 House Activity The testing and evaluation stage was the House Activity , which acted as the ultimate test of whether I could apply all the commands I had learned. Instead of being a linear maze, the House required me to move through rooms, inspect items, and complete tasks. This activity was a file system directory simulated as a house that I was required to navigate through. This tested not only my command knowledge but also my ability to adapt and think logically to navigate throught the different directories and find out information and even remove/edit information. For example, starting in the \u201challway\u201d, you would have to use pwd to confirm your location, then use cd to enter specific rooms like the Kitchen and ls to check what was inside. Some rooms required cleaning up files and even discovering trash(hidden files in the garage directory), so you had to be sharp and disocver hiddden files and delete with rm. Also, some tasks required creating notes using nano and leaving messages for the owner. Some Commands Used and Why Step Action Command(s) Evaluation Locate self Check starting directory pwd Correct path displayed Move to room Enter Kitchen cd Kitchen Successful navigation to different areas of the house Inspect room List files ls Saw visible items like food (files) Clean up Delete file rm trash.txt Removed unnecessary files like garbage Create note Add message nano note.txt Left messages for the house owner Reveal hidden Show hidden items ls -a Found secret files (hidden garbage in the garage) Navigating through the kitchen directory, taking out fruit and getting rid of rotten fruit: Navigating through the garage directory, finding hidden trash and removing it: Bugs & Fixes: - Initially forgot to use ls -a and missed hidden files; fixed after retracing steps. - Used wrong capitalization ( cd kitchen instead of cd Kitchen ); corrected to work. This activity served as the final test combining skills from the Ubuntu tutorial and both Map the Maze parts. 5. Reflection Completing the CLI assignments gave me a deeper understanding of how to navigate the command line and file tree system. Through Map the Maze I & II and the House Activity, I learned that precision and attention to detail are critical: even small mistakes, like a wrong directory name or missed hidden file, can prevent progress. I also recognized the importance of planning and iteration. By breaking each activity into smaller steps, testing commands, and observing their effects, I troubleshoot and find hidden files or find the files I needed to change. The project reinforced the value of combining foundational skills with real-world application, such as mounting shared directories or managing multiple files simultaneously. Finally, this project helped to improve my problem-solving skills and adaptability. Navigating the simulated house and discovering hidden files required logical thinking and making sure the right files were removed/editied and hidden files were found. Along with that, I am beginning to develop skills to troubleshoot networks by searching connectivity to the wifi, ip addresses over the network, and confirming through Domain Same Server(DNS). Overall, I now feel more competent in using the Linux command line and troubleshooting through networks, and I understand how these skills will support future technical challenges.","title":"Command Line Interface"},{"location":"classes/ap-networking/202509CLI/#command-line-interface-cli","text":"","title":"Command Line Interface (CLI)"},{"location":"classes/ap-networking/202509CLI/#1-project-overview","text":"Problem Statement: Learn to navigate and manage a Linux system through the command line, practicing foundational Ubuntu commands while applying them in structured challenges.

Reflection"},{"location":"classes/ap-networking/202509SecurityControls/","text":"Determining Security Controls for Devices 1. Project Overview Problem Statement: Learn how devices connect to the internet, diagnose network issues using the 4-step troubleshooting flow, and apply/discover cybersecurity strategies and systems. Objectives: - Use Mac and Ubuntu CLI tools ( ifconfig , ip addr , ping , netstat , ufw ) to test connectivity - Apply the 4-step troubleshooting flow - Identify and evaluate open network ports/services on a VM - Enable firewall rules (UFW) and explore encryption basics Success Criteria: - Correctly perform network checks on Mac and Ubuntu VMs - Identify security risks (extra ports, unencrypted disks) - Enable and test a firewall/encryptions in Ubuntu 2. Design & Planning - Troubleshooting Flow & Vocabulary Troubleshooting Flow: Learned to always start at the endpoint device and test systematically: Check connection (Wi-Fi/Ethernet, VM mode). Verify IP address. Test reachability with ping. Confirm DNS lookups. Networking Vocabulary Wi-Fi/Ethernet: ways devices connect to the internet IP address: unique identifier for a device on the network Default gateway: router connecting local network to the internet DNS: translates names (google.com) to IP addresses Ping: tests connectivity between devices NAT (shared): VM hides behind host device Bridged networking: VM acts like its own device Cybersecurity Fundamentals \u2013 CIA Triad Confidentiality: keeping information secret from unauthorized users (e.g., encryption). Integrity: ensuring data remains accurate, uncorrupted, and trustworthy. Availability: making sure information and systems are accessible when needed. Common Device Vulnerabilities Outdated operating systems - missing security updates. Unencrypted data - easier for attackers to read if stolen. Weak passwords - can be cracked - use strong/random generation. Open ports - entry points like \u201cdoors/windows\" - necessary for services but must be managed. Examples: 80 (HTTP \u2013 old websites) 443 (HTTPS \u2013 secure websites) 22 (SSH \u2013 remote login) 25 (SMTP \u2013 email transfer) 110 (POP3) 143 (IMAP) 3389 (RDP \u2013 remote desktop) 53 (DNS \u2013 domain lookups) Unpatched software - vulnerabilities fixed by updates/patches (Windows \u201cPatch Tuesday,\u201d browser updates, mobile app patches). Tree Diagram of Termonology: 3. Technical Development \u2013 Network Testing and Cybersecurity Labs In the technical development stage , moved from theory into practical work by testing networks on both Mac and Ubuntu and applying cybersecurity measures. On Mac, began with ifconfig to identify my IP address. The result showed a valid private address ( 10.x.x.x ), confirming that my device was connected to the school\u2019s network. When toggling WIFI on and off, the IP disappeared and then reappeared. Next, tested connectivity by pinging public servers. Using ping -c 4 8.8.8.8 (google DNS) gave a fast average response time of about 7 ms. Pinging Cloudflare ( 1.1.1.1 ) worked as well, but slightly slower at 8 ms. To compare, pinged the school\u2019s default gateway ( 10.32.0.1 ) and found it responded even faster (0.9 ms) since it was local. Finally, I confirmed DNS resolution with ping google.com , proving that my device could translate names to IP addresses. On Ubuntu, I used ip addr to check IP addresses in both shared (NAT) and bridged modes. Shared gave me a 192.168.x.x address, meaning the VM was hidden behind my Mac, while bridged gave me a 10.x.x.x address, showing the VM could act like its own device. This side-by-side testing taught me the trade-offs between convenience (shared mode) and realism (bridged mode). I also began applying cybersecurity practices by checking for open ports with netstat -tuln . Ports like 22 (SSH) and 53 (DNS) were expected, but I also saw port 631 for printing, which wasn\u2019t needed. To improve security, I enabled Ubuntu\u2019s firewall using sudo ufw enable and blocked Telnet on port 23 with sudo ufw deny 23/tcp . Key Tasks and Results Task Command(s) Used Findings Check IP on Mac ifconfig Found private IP: 10.12.17.223 (valid 10.x.x.x range) Disconnect/reconnect Wi-Fi ifconfig Observed IP disappearing/reappearing when Wi-Fi toggled Ping Google (8.8.8.8) ping -c 4 8.8.8.8 Success, avg 7.237 ms Ping Cloudflare (1.1.1.1) ping -c 4 1.1.1.1 Success, avg 8.717 ms (slower than Google) Find default gateway route -n get default (mac) / ip route (ubuntu) Mac: 10.32.0.1 , Ubuntu: 192.168.62.1 Ping router ping -c 4 <gateway> Very fast response (0.963 ms), faster than public servers Test DNS ping -c 4 google.com Successful \u2013 showed DNS was resolving correctly Check IP on Ubuntu (shared) ip addr IP: 192.168.64.2/24 (hidden behind Mac) Check IP on Ubuntu (bridged) ip addr IP: 10.32.1.33/23 (acts like its own device) Scan open ports netstat -tuln Found SSH, DNS, and unnecessary ports Enable firewall sudo ufw enable Activated UFW protection Block insecure service sudo ufw deny 23/tcp Closed Telnet port IP address info on Ubuntu shared mode: - Red is adapter name - Blue is the IP address - Green is MAC address Finding the ports: Enable Firewall: Closed TCP Port: 4. Testing & Evaluation \u2013 Outdated Software The testing & evaluation phase taught us about outdated software and potential risks. In the VM, we would use different commands to install certain softwares and test to see what verion they were. After finding out the version, the goal was to compare the version on the VM to the most updated version. In my case, most of the VM softwares was not up to date. We also had to determine the risks for the software not being up to date. Software Command Used VM Version Why It Matters (Risk) OpenSSL openssl version Outdated Encrypts data on websites could be leaked Firefox firefox --version Outdated Supports open web and user privacy, web services not up to date LibreOffice libreoffice --version Outdated Alternative to commercial office suits Python python3 --version Outdated Coding languages lots of libraries built off of Apache HTTP Server apache2 -v Up to Date Web infrastructure, sites could fail GIMP gimp --version Outdated Digital editing, limited user interface Java java -version Outdated Code might not run properly OpenSSH ssh -V Outdated Secure connections to remote servers Example Installing and Checking Version(Firefox): 5. Reflection Completing these networking and cybersecurity activities gave me a much deeper understanding of both troubleshooting and defending systems.

On Mac, began with ifconfig to identify my IP address. The result showed a valid private address ( 10.x.x.x ), confirming that my device was connected to the school\u2019s network. When toggling WIFI on and off, the IP disappeared and then reappeared. Next, tested connectivity by pinging public servers. Using ping -c 4 8.8.8.8 (google DNS) gave a fast average response time of about 7 ms. Pinging Cloudflare ( 1.1.1.1 ) worked as well, but slightly slower at 8 ms. To compare, pinged the school\u2019s default gateway ( 10.32.0.1 ) and found it responded even faster (0.9 ms) since it was local. Finally, I confirmed DNS resolution with ping google.com , proving that my device could translate names to IP addresses. On Ubuntu, I used ip addr to check IP addresses in both shared (NAT) and bridged modes. Shared gave me a 192.168.x.x address, meaning the VM was hidden behind my Mac, while bridged gave me a 10.x.x.x address, showing the VM could act like its own device. This side-by-side testing taught me the trade-offs between convenience (shared mode) and realism (bridged mode). I also began applying cybersecurity practices by checking for open ports with netstat -tuln .

Project Overview Problem Statement: Understand how to strengthen device authentication and system security by designing secure passwords, enabling multi-factor authentication (MFA), and maintaining system integrity through regular software patching and updates. Objectives: - Design a strong password algorithm that meets NIST and OWASP guidelines - Change the default Ubuntu password using an algorithm-generated strong password - Install and configure MFA (pam_google_authenticator) for secure SSH logins - Perform and verify system patching using Ubuntu\u2019s update and log tools Success Criteria: - Password algorithm demonstrates length, complexity, and unpredictability - MFA setup confirmed with working verification code and SSH login test - System logs show successful patching activity and current updates applied - Reflection connects password policies, MFA, and patching to better security 2. Design & Planning \u2013 Authentication Concepts & Password Algorithm Password Security Foundations Strong passwords rely on three core factors: length, complexity, and unpredictability. Longer passwords increase combinations an attacker must guess, complexity adds varied character types (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols), and unpredictability prevents attackers from using known patterns or personal information. Common threats include brute force, dictionary attacks, and credential stuffing, all of which can be mitigated by using random password generation and MFA. To strengthen authentication, industry standards such as NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) and OWASP (Open Worldwide Application Security Project) emphasize: - Favoring length over forced compelxity - Enabling multi-factor authentication - Blocking weak or reused passwords The below demonstrates how different authentication methods work together: Password Algorithm - ensures unpredictability MFA - adds verification beyond password Patching - protects system from known exploits Designed Password Algorithm The password generation method created for this unit used random selections of letters, numbers, and symbols to ensure unpredictability and security.

Technical Development \u2013 Implementing Authentication & Security This phase focused on applying and verifying authentication controls in Ubuntu, including password updates, MFA setup, and patching through CLI commands. Changing Default Password Using the Ubuntu terminal, the command passwd was executed to replace the default ubuntu password with a new one generated by the algorithm. Command used: passwd New password set: Used password alogrithm above to generate a complex password Verification: Successful authentication tested with sudo ls /root , confirming that the new password functioned with administrative privileges. Additional user management commands enhanced overall security: - sudo adduser <username> \u2013 Create a new personal account - sudo usermod -aG sudo <username> \u2013 Grant administrative permissions - sudo passwd -l ubuntu \u2013 Lock the default user account to prevent unauthorized access Changing Password: Successful Password Change: Enabling Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) MFA was implemented using Google Authenticator through the following process: Installation - sudo apt update - sudo apt install libpam-google-authenticator -y Setup - google-authenticator generated a QR code and secret key for time-based codes (TOTP) MFA QR Code: Configuration - SSH configuration edited to enable MFA in /etc/ssh/sshd_config - PAM stack modified by adding auth required pam_google_authenticator.so in /etc/pam.d/sshd Testing - MFA verified using simulated TOTP code from https://totp.danhersam.com - SSH login prompted for both password and 6-digit verification code MFA Success: System Patching and Updates Software patching was performed to fix vulnerabilities and ensure up-to-date security protection.

These unpatched systems could easily allow in data leaks and breaches through many different doors. Additionally, there may be zero-day vulnerabilities, security flaws that aren\u2019t recognized by the user, therefore no patches available. If hackers are able to find these zero-day vulnerabilities they could easily enter the system and the fix would take a while depending on if the user even found the leak. To ensure that patching happens, you could always try to use automatic updates so the computer always stays patched and up to date. 5. Reflection Through implementing layered security controls, this unit demonstrated the practical relationship between authentication, authorization, and system maintenance. Secure passwords protect confidentiality and MFA safeguards protect integrity by ensuring that access is verified. Additionally, consistent patching preserves availability by maintaining a functional and resilient system to both bugs and attacks. These activities reinforced the principle that cybersecurity requires defense in depth\u2014multiple layers working together rather than relying on a single control. The Ubuntu password algorithm exercise showed how unpredictability and length drastically reduce guessing risk. MFA through Google Authenticator demonstrated real-world two-factor authentication methods used by major organizations, adding an essential safeguard against stolen credentials and hackers. Patching the VM provided insight into how software vulnerabilities are discovered and fixed, highlighting the importance of staying updated against known and zero-day exploits. Regular updates also prevent attackers from using exploits in the wild that target unpatched systems. Patching helps to protect against \"open doors\" in systems for hackers to break there way into. Overall, this unit illustrated the importance of proactive protection to ensure cyber attacks don't happen and data isn't lost.","title":"Implementing Security for Devices"},{"location":"classes/ap-networking/202510ImplementSecurity/#implementing-security-for-devices","text":"","title":"Implementing Security for Devices"},{"location":"classes/ap-networking/202510ImplementSecurity/#1-project-overview","text":"Problem Statement: Understand how to strengthen device authentication and system security by designing secure passwords, enabling multi-factor authentication (MFA), and maintaining system integrity through regular software patching and updates.

Technical Development \u2013 Ubuntu Networking Activities This phase focused on applying and verifying networking concepts in Ubuntu through command line tools. Installing Network Tools and Viewing IP Configuration Installation Commands: sudo apt update sudo apt install net-tools -y Viewing Network Configuration: ifconfig Understanding the Output: Term Meaning Purpose Example inet The IPv4 address assigned to the computer It identifies the computer on the network 192.168.64.6 \u2014 computer's unique address within your local network netmask Defines which portion of the IP address identifies the network and which part identifies the device Helps devices know who is on the same network and who is outside it 255.255.255.0 - the first three sets of numbers (192.168.64) identify the network, the last number (.6) identifies the specific device broadcast The broadcast address is used to send messages to all devices on the same local network used by computers to find each other 192.168.64.255 sends data to all devices in the 192.168.64 network Network Configuration Screenshot: Testing Connectivity with Ping Installation: sudo apt install iputils-ping -y Testing Commands: ping google.com ping 8.8.8.8 -c 3 Quick Explanation: Command Purpose Example Output ifconfig Shows your computer's network address 192.168.64.6 ping Tests if another computer or website is reachable 64 bytes from google.com traceroute Shows the route data takes to reach a destination 192.168.64.1 --> 10.0.0.1 Ping Test Results: Tracing Network Routes with Traceroute Installation: sudo apt install traceroute -y Testing: traceroute google.com My Results: How many hops: 23 How long did it take: 3 seconds Understanding traceroute Results: When you type traceroute google.com , the computer sends test packets of data toward Google's servers and keeps track of every \"hop\" that those packets pass through. Each hop is like a checkpoint between your computer and the destination. The data might travel through many routers, like the school network and city network, before it finally reaches Google. Traceroute Results: Binary, Decimal, and Hexadecimal Conversions Why Binary: All digital data is stored + transmitted with binary (base 2) Computers have signals -> \"1 is on\" or \"0 is off\" Use on/off to store: IP addresses MAC addresses (unique identifier for hardware) Packets Number Systems: Decimal or \"denary\" - humans 10 digits -> 0 to 9 Ones (10^0), tens (10^1), hundred (10^2),... 345 = 3(10^2) + 4(10^1) + 5(10^0) Binary - base 2 Each binary digit is a bit 8 bits = 1 byte 4 bits = nibble Example: 192.168.1.1 = 11000000.10101000.00000001.00000001 Hexadecimal - base 16 Example: 11000000101010000000000100000001 in hex is C0A80101 Each hex digit = 4 bits Binary to Hex to Denary Practice: IP Address Analysis with ipcalc Checking My IP Address: ip a My IP Address: 192.168.64.2/24 The IP address you see is shown in decimal form so humans can read it easily. However, your computer stores and processes it in binary, like this: 192.168.64.6 -> 11000000.10101000.01000000.00000110. Every device on the network communicates using these 1s and 0s, not the decimal numbers you see on the screen. Additionally, the /24 is called the subnet mask and it tells you how many of the 32 bits in the IP address belong to the network portion. Hexadecimal is also often used because it allows for the compression of binary numbers. Ipcalc: sudo apt install ipcalc -y ipcalc 192.168.64.6/24 Ipcalc Output Screenshot: Viewing IP in Hexadecimal Converting to Hex: printf '%02X%02X%02X%02X\\n' 192 168 64 6 Output: C0A84006 Each pair of hex digits represents one section (octet) of the IP address: A8 = 168 40 = 64 06 = 6 Hexadecimal IP Screenshot: VM to VM Network Communication Understand how data travels between two computers on the same LAN using real network tools. Identify Your IP Address Same commands as above, but both VM's need to find networking information. Commands used: ifconfig or ip a The IP addresses are how devices identify each other on a local network. Each VM will have a different IP address and devices need both to communicate. Test Connectivity with Ping Ping the partner VM IP address to test if connection between both VM's is stable. Command: ping <VM2_IP> Example: ping 192.168.64.7 Ping uses the ICMP protocol at the Network Layer to check if another device is reachable. Each \"reply\" means data successfully traveled to your partner's VM and back. Ping Between VMs Screenshot: View Active Network Connections Command: netstat -a or if netstat isn't found: sudo apt install net-tools -y The netstat command displays transport layer information (Layer 4). It shows which ports are open and which protocols are being used for communication between both VM's. Netstat Screenshot: After connecting, the two VM's can communicate with each other using netcat . VM to VM Communication:: 4. Testing & Evaluation \u2013 Network Verification All implemented networking concepts were tested for proper operation. Concept Test Performed Verification Result IP Configuration ifconfig command Successfully identified inet (IP), netmask, and broadcast addresses Network Connectivity ping google.com and ping 8.8.8.8 All packets received with 22ms latency, 0% packet loss Route Tracing traceroute google.com Mapped 23 hops from local gateway to Google servers in 3 seconds Binary Conversion Manual calculation verified with bc All conversions accurate (e.g., 10101000 = 168) Hexadecimal Analysis printf command and ipcalc IP address correctly displayed as C0A84002 Open Ports netstat Identified open ports between 2 VM's VM Communication ping between VMs Successful connectivity with low latency Message Transfer netcat between VMs Text message delivered reliably using TCP 5. Reflection Through these networking labs, I gained a practical understanding of how data moves across networks and how the OSI and TCP/IP models apply in the transmission of data across devices and networks. The LAN city analogy helped make complex ideas more. Additionally, the binary, decimal, and hexadecimal conversion exercises showed why computers use binary and how hexadecimal provides a human readable shortcut for long binary values. Using ipcalc, ping, traceroute, and netcat helped to demonstrate the real world applications of the OSI layers. The traceroute activity showed the real world jumps between networks as it showed 23 hops my data took to reach Google\u2019s servers and how the latency varied between them. The VM to VM activity tied everything together as it ensured I knew how to make sure two different devices where connect and could transport data between each other. Understanding both OSI and TCP/IP clarified how each layer depends on the one below and serves the one above, an essential principle to teh success of the OSI layer and the transportation of data. Overall, these labs transformed networking from abstract theory into practical skills as I can now interpret network configurations, test connectivity, trace routes, and understand how data actually travels across the internet.","title":"Data Movement and Types of Networks"},{"location":"classes/ap-networking/202511Data/#data-movement-and-types-of-networks","text":"","title":"Data Movement and Types of Networks"},{"location":"classes/ap-networking/202511Data/#1-project-overview","text":"Problem Statement: Understand how data moves across networks by exploring LAN components, the OSI and TCP/IP models, and binary/hexadecimal conversions.

Typically, in daily life, all four different networks are used. For the PAN, it is whenever you are connecting or using different personal device, like an iPhone. For LAN's, it is often used in your workplaces or at school. MAN's are used to connect different network across city areas, like traffic signals. Finally, WAN's are used to connect the whole world together, like the internet. Each network scales up and connects with both larger and smaller ones.

These unpatched systems could easily allow in data leaks and breaches through many different doors. Additionally, there may be zero-day vulnerabilities, security flaws that aren\u2019t recognized by the user, therefore no patches available. If hackers are able to find these zero-day vulnerabilities they could easily enter the system and the fix would take a while depending on if the user even found the leak. To ensure that patching happens, you could always try to use automatic updates so the computer always stays patched and up to date.","title":"Why Patching Matters/Outdaded Software:"},{"location":"classes/ap-networking/202511TypesNetwork/#5-reflection","text":"Through implementing layered security controls, this unit demonstrated the practical relationship between authentication, authorization, and system maintenance. Secure passwords protect confidentiality and MFA safeguards protect integrity by ensuring that access is verified. Additionally, consistent patching preserves availability by maintaining a functional and resilient system to both bugs and attacks. These activities reinforced the principle that cybersecurity requires defense in depth\u2014multiple layers working together rather than relying on a single control. The Ubuntu password algorithm exercise showed how unpredictability and length drastically reduce guessing risk. MFA through Google Authenticator demonstrated real-world two-factor authentication methods used by major organizations, adding an essential safeguard against stolen credentials and hackers. Patching the VM provided insight into how software vulnerabilities are discovered and fixed, highlighting the importance of staying updated against known and zero-day exploits. Regular updates also prevent attackers from using exploits in the wild that target unpatched systems. Patching helps to protect against \"open doors\" in systems for hackers to break there way into. Overall, this unit illustrated the importance of proactive protection to ensure cyber attacks don't happen and data isn't lost.","title":"5. Reflection"}]}
