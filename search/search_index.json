Design &amp; Planning \u2013 Map the Maze I &amp; Ubuntu Tutorial","text":"<p>The design and planning stage focused on building a foundation for understanding the file tree system, working in the Ubuntu command line, and learning the necessary skills to navigate through the command line. Starting with Map the Maze I, it introduced me first to the different termonology for understanding file paths and how they work, such as what a parent directory is vs a root directory. After that, Map the Maze I taught me about many basic commands like <code>pwd</code> (to check my current directory), <code>cd</code> (to move into another directory), and <code>ls</code> (to see the contents of a folder). The activity helped me to . This helped me understand that the CLI requires precision: a mistyped command or wrong directory name will not work.  </p> <p>At the same time, I followed the Ubuntu tutorial, which gave me a broader context for why these commands matter. It covered file creation (<code>mkdir</code>, <code>touch</code>), file editing (<code>nano</code>), and system commands like <code>chmod</code> (to change permissions) or <code>top</code> (to monitor running processes). This tutorial complemented Map the Maze I by showing real-world uses of the same basic skills I was practicing. </p> <p>Together, Map the Maze I and the tutorial gave me the tools I needed for the next phases of the project. They also served as my \u201cplan,\u201d since I now had a clear set of commands I could apply to more complex tasks.  </p> <p>File Treey System Termonology: | Term             | Definition / Example | |-----------------|--------------------| | Root Directory (/ or C:) | Very top of the file system tree. On Mac/Linux, it\u2019s represented as a single slash <code>/</code>. On Windows, it usually starts with a drive letter, such as <code>C:\\</code>. All folders and files branch downward from this starting point, like branches from the trunk of a tree. Example: On Windows, <code>C:\\Users\\John\\Documents\\essay.docx</code> begins at <code>C:\\</code> (the root). On Mac, <code>/Users/John/Documents/essay.docx</code> begins at <code>/</code> (the root). | | Folder (Directory) | A folder, also called a directory, is a container used to organize files and other folders. Helps organize related files. Example: A folder named <code>Documents</code> might contain files like <code>essay.docx</code> and <code>budget.xlsx</code> and a subfolder named <code>School</code>. | | File | A file is a single digital object that holds data, such as text, images, video, or code. Example: <code>notes.txt</code> is a text file, <code>photo.jpg</code> is an image file. | | Path | A path is the \u201caddress\u201d of a file or folder, showing its location inside the file system. Path written as a sequence of folder names separated by slashes (<code>/</code>) on Mac/Linux or backslashes (<code>\\</code>) on Windows. Example: Mac/Linux: <code>/Users/John/Documents/essay.docx</code> ; Windows: <code>C:\\Users\\John\\Documents\\essay.docx</code>. | | Absolute Path | Absolute path gives the complete address of a file, starting at the root directory. Example: Mac/Linux: <code>/Users/John/Documents/essay.docx</code> ; Windows: <code>C:\\Users\\John\\Documents\\essay.docx</code>. | | Relative Path | A relative path shows the location of a file or folder starting from your current working directory (where you are right now). Example: If your current folder is <code>/Users/John</code>, the relative path to <code>essay.docx</code> in <code>Documents</code> is <code>Documents/essay.docx</code>. |</p> <p>CLI Commands: | Command | Purpose | Example | |---------|---------|---------| | <code>pwd</code> | Show current directory | <code>/home/student</code> | | <code>ls</code> | List files and folders | <code>ls -a</code> | | <code>cd</code> | Change directory | <code>cd Documents</code> | | <code>mkdir</code> | Create directory | <code>mkdir Maze</code> | | <code>touch</code> | Create file | <code>touch clue.txt</code> | | <code>nano</code> | Edit a file | <code>nano clue.txt</code> |  </p> <ul> <li>Example Text Version of My File System Tree I Drew</li> </ul>"},{"location":"classes/ap-networking/202509CLI/#3-technical-development-map-the-maze-ii","title":"3. Technical Development \u2013 Map the Maze II","text":"<p>In the technical development stage, I worked through Map the Maze II, which expanded on the basics from Maze I. This activity required me not just to move around directories, but also to create, edit, copy, and discover hidden files. For example, I used <code>touch</code> to create files, <code>nano</code> to edit their contents, and <code>cp</code> to duplicate them. One of the biggest lessons was using <code>ls -a</code> to reveal hidden files, which showed me that sometimes information is present but not visible without the right command.  </p> <p>This activity also gave me practice in versioning: each step built on the last. At first, I simply navigated and confirmed my location. Then I began creating and editing files. Finally, I put it all together by managing multiple files and finding/creating my own hidden clues.  </p> <p>Some Commands Used and Why: | Task | Command(s) Used | Notes | |------|----------------|-------| | Navigate directories | <code>cd</code>, <code>pwd</code> | Used constantly to stay oriented | | Create folder | <code>mkdir MazeGame</code> | Built a workspace | | Create file | <code>touch clue1.txt</code> | Added clue file | | Edit file | <code>nano clue1.txt</code> | Inserted instructions | | Mount PC | <code>sudo mount -t davfs http://127.0.0.1:9843/ ~/hostshare/</code> | Allow sharing file from Mac to virtual Machine | | Show hidden files | <code>ls -a</code> | Discovered hidden files in Maze Game |  </p> <ul> <li>Editing clue1 and reading what was inside</li> <li>Sharing Clue1 onto hostshare so both mac and ubuntu can access</li> </ul> <p>By the end of Map the Maze II, I could confidently use multiple commands together to solve more complex tasks</p>"},{"location":"classes/ap-networking/202509CLI/#4-testing-evaluation-house-activity","title":"4. Testing &amp; Evaluation \u2013 House Activity","text":"<p>The testing and evaluation stage was the House Activity, which acted as the ultimate test of whether I could apply all the commands I had learned. Instead of being a linear maze, the House required me to move through rooms, inspect items, and complete tasks. This activity was a file system directory simulated as a house that I was required to navigate through. This tested not only my command knowledge but also my ability to adapt and think logically to navigate throught the different directories and find out information and even remove/edit information.</p> <p>For example, starting in the \u201challway\u201d, you would have to use <code>pwd</code> to confirm your location, then use <code>cd</code> to enter specific rooms like the Kitchen and <code>ls</code> to check what was inside. Some rooms required cleaning up files and even discovering trash(hidden files in the garage directory), so you had to be sharp and disocver hiddden files and delete with <code>rm</code>. Also, some tasks required creating notes using <code>nano</code> and leaving messages for the owner.</p> <p>Some Commands Used and Why: | Step | Action | Command(s) | Evaluation | |------|--------|------------|------------| | Locate self | Check starting directory | <code>pwd</code> | Correct path displayed | | Move to room | Enter Kitchen | <code>cd Kitchen</code> | Successful navigation to different ares of the house(directories) | | Inspect room | List files | <code>ls</code> | Saw visible items like food(files) | | Clean up | Delete file | <code>rm trash.txt</code> | Removed unnecessary files like files with garbage| | Create note | Add message | <code>nano note.txt</code> | Left messages for the house owner | | Reveal hidden | Show hidden items | <code>ls -a</code> | Found secret files(like hidden garbage in the garage) |  </p> <ul> <li>Navigating through the kitchen directory, taking out fruit and getting rid of rotten fruit</li> <li>Navigating through the garage directory, finding hidden trash and removing it</li> </ul> <p>Bugs &amp; Fixes: - I initially forgot to use <code>ls -a</code> and missed hidden files. This was fixed after I retraced my steps to find the hidden trash. - I once used the wrong capitalization in a directory name (<code>cd kitchen</code> instead of <code>cd Kitchen</code>), which didn\u2019t work until I corrected it.
