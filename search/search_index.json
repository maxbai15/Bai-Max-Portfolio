Design &amp; Planning \u2013 Map the Maze I &amp; Ubuntu Tutorial","text":"<p>The design and planning stage focused on building a foundation for understanding the file tree system, working in the Ubuntu command line, and learning the necessary skills to navigate through the command line. Starting with Map the Maze I, it introduced me first to the different terminology for understanding file paths and how they work, such as what a parent directory is vs a root directory. After that, Map the Maze I taught me about many basic commands like <code>pwd</code> (to check my current directory), <code>cd</code> (to move into another directory), and <code>ls</code> (to see the contents of a folder). This helped me understand that the CLI requires precision: a mistyped command or wrong directory name will not work.  </p> <p>At the same time, I followed the Ubuntu tutorial, which gave me a broader context for why these commands matter. It covered file creation (<code>mkdir</code>, <code>touch</code>) and file editing (<code>nano</code>). This tutorial complemented Map the Maze I by showing real-world uses of the same basic skills I was practicing.  </p> <p>Together, Map the Maze I and the tutorial gave me the tools I needed for the next phases of the project.

On Mac/Linux, it\u2019s represented as a single slash <code>/</code>. On Windows, it usually starts with a drive letter, such as <code>C:\\</code>. All folders and files branch downward from this starting point, like branches from the trunk of a tree. Example: On Windows, <code>C:\\Users\\John\\Documents\\essay.docx</code> begins at <code>C:\\</code> (the root). On Mac, <code>/Users/John/Documents/essay.docx</code> begins at <code>/</code> (the root). Folder (Directory) A folder, also called a directory, is a container used to organize files and other folders. Helps organize related files. Example: A folder named <code>Documents</code> might contain files like <code>essay.docx</code> and <code>budget.xlsx</code> and a subfolder named <code>School</code>. File A file is a single digital object that holds data, such as text, images, video, or code. Example: <code>notes.txt</code> is a text file, <code>photo.jpg</code> is an image file. Path A path is the \u201caddress\u201d of a file or folder, showing its location inside the file system. Path written as a sequence of folder names separated by slashes (<code>/</code>) on Mac/Linux or backslashes (<code>\\</code>) on Windows. Example: Mac/Linux: <code>/Users/John/Documents/essay.docx</code> ; Windows: <code>C:\\Users\\John\\Documents\\essay.docx</code>. Absolute Path Absolute path gives the complete address of a file, starting at the root directory. Example: Mac/Linux: <code>/Users/John/Documents/essay.docx</code> ; Windows: <code>C:\\Users\\John\\Documents\\essay.docx</code>. Relative Path A relative path shows the location of a file or folder starting from your current working directory (where you are right now). Example: If your current folder is <code>/Users/John</code>, the relative path to <code>essay.docx</code> in <code>Documents</code> is <code>Documents/essay.docx</code>."},{"location":"classes/ap-networking/202509CLI/#cli-commands","title":"CLI Commands","text":"Command Purpose Example <code>pwd</code> Show current directory <code>/home/student</code> <code>ls</code> List files and folders <code>ls -a</code> <code>cd</code> Change directory <code>cd Documents</code> <code>mkdir</code> Create directory <code>mkdir Maze</code> <code>touch</code> Create file <code>touch clue.txt</code> <code>nano</code> Edit a file <code>nano clue.txt</code> <p>Example Text Version of My File System Tree I Drew: </p>"},{"location":"classes/ap-networking/202509CLI/#3-technical-development-map-the-maze-ii","title":"3. Technical Development \u2013 Map the Maze II","text":"<p>In the technical development stage, I worked through Map the Maze II, which expanded on the basics from Maze I. This activity required me not just to move around directories, but also to create, edit, copy, and discover hidden files. For example, I used touch to create files, nano to edit their contents, and cp to duplicate them. One of the biggest lessons was using ls -a to reveal hidden files, which showed me that sometimes information is present but not visible without the right command. This activity also gave me practice in versioning: each step built on the last. At first, I simply navigated and confirmed my location. Then I began creating and editing files.

Instead of being a linear maze, the House required me to move through rooms, inspect items, and complete tasks. This activity was a file system directory simulated as a house that I was required to navigate through. This tested not only my command knowledge but also my ability to adapt and think logically to navigate throught the different directories and find out information and even remove/edit information. For example, starting in the \u201challway\u201d, you would have to use pwd to confirm your location, then use cd to enter specific rooms like the Kitchen and ls to check what was inside. Some rooms required cleaning up files and even discovering trash(hidden files in the garage directory), so you had to be sharp and disocver hiddden files and delete with rm.

Reflection","text":"<p>Completing the CLI assignments gave me a deeper understanding of how to navigate the command line and file tree system. Through Map the Maze I &amp; II and the House Activity, I learned that precision and attention to detail are critical: even small mistakes, like a wrong directory name or missed hidden file, can prevent progress. I also recognized the importance of planning and iteration. By breaking each activity into smaller steps, testing commands, and observing their effects, I troubleshoot and find hidden files or find the files I needed to change. The project reinforced the value of combining foundational skills with real-world application, such as mounting shared directories or managing multiple files simultaneously. Finally, this project helped to improve my problem-solving skills and adaptability. Navigating the simulated house and discovering hidden files required logical thinking and , making sure the right files were removed/editied and hidden files were found. Overall, I now feel more competent in using the Linux command line, and I understand how these skills will support future technical challenges.</p>"},{"location":"classes/ap-networking/202509component-cards/","title":"Hardware &amp; Software Components","text":""},{"location":"classes/ap-networking/202509component-cards/#1-project-overview","title":"1.

Reflection &amp; Analysis","text":"<p>I learned how hardware and software work together to perform computing tasks. The CPU acts as the brain, RAM temporarily stores data, and the GPU accelerates display and computation. Software layers allow applications to communicate with hardware through drivers and the OS. The Build-A-PC challenge helped me learn to make trade-offs to optimize for gaming, balancing cost, and performance. These lessons mirror real-world computing and network system design. By learning the basic components, we can understand how pcs function and work. If there every was a problem or a component needed to be upgraded, we could determine which one.
